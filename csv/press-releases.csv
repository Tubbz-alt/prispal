	Architects Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners (RSHP) have been selected to create a new full scale commission as part of Wellcome Collection’s major autumn exhibition, Living with Buildings. Taking over two galleries, this multi-storey exhibition will explore the pivotal role of design and urban planning in human health, considering the ways in which the built environment reflects the needs of society in the past, present and future.</p>
<p>RSHP were chosen from an open call to create an architectural project within Wellcome Collection’s first floor gallery. The commission will comprise a mobile clinic, developed for and with Doctors of the World, in response to the urgent need for effective, adaptable healthcare in emergency situations and remote locations. With combined design and engineering expertise from RSHP, BuroHappold and Chapman BDSP, and a wealth of field experience from Doctors of the World, these structures hold the potential to be the temporary health clinic of the future.</p>
<p>RSHP are an award-winning and international practice based in London. They are known for their work on a wide range of projects, from residential to cultural to commercial as well as educational. Their health-oriented buildings include Stirling Prize winner, Maggie’s West London (2008) and the Cancer Centre at Guy’s Hospital (2016). They have also designed PLACE/Ladywell, a residential development for 24 homeless families in London. Working alongside collaborators and clients, they are committed to exploring the innovative ways that architecture can positively impact the way we live.</p>
<p>Ivan Harbour, architect and senior partner at RSHP, says “Architecture has the ability and responsibility to improve people’s lives and nowhere is this more important than at times of emergency and crisis. This transportable clinic aims to be simple and economic to build, enabling those in the field to focus on what really matters: the health and care of their patients.”</p>
<p>Richard Rogers, architect and founding partner at RSHP, says: “We are thrilled to be part of Living with Buildings. Seeing the mobile clinic structure take shape at Wellcome Collection in the context of an exhibition about architecture, society and health will be a dream come true.”</p>
<p>Visitors will have the opportunity to see the commission unveiled as part of a ‘live build’ phase, as well as concepts and background research relating to its development and eventual deployment.</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection’s ground floor gallery will house over 100 objects, examining how the structures that surround and shape us contribute to our mental and physical health, in both positive and negative ways. Featuring the work of artists and photographers including Giles Round, Andreas Gursky and Rachel Whiteread, Living with Buildings will consider the perspectives of those who live and heal in buildings, as well as those who design them.</p>
<p>Curator Emily Sargent says: “We are delighted to award Wellcome Collection’s first architectural commission to RSHP. The mobile clinic demonstrates the positive impact design can have on how healthcare is delivered and received across the world. It will form a striking and forward-looking addition to the wider exhibition, expanding the conversation around health and architecture.”</p>
<p>Living with Buildings opens at Wellcome Collection on 04 October 2018 until spring 2019 and is curated by Emily Sargent. The exhibition has inspired a book – Living with Buildings – by bestselling author Iain Sinclair, to be published by Wellcome Collection and Profile Books in September 2018.</p>

	In October 2018, a major exhibition at Wellcome Collection will explore the pivotal role of design and urban planning in human health. <em>Living with Buildings</em> will take over both of the museum’s temporary exhibition spaces to examine how the structures that surround us shape our mental and physical health, in both positive and negative ways.</p>
<p>From Dickensian slums to high-rise towers, and infirmary tents to modernist sanatoriums, this will be the first exhibition to chart how shifts in thinking and approaches to design have impacted on health and wellbeing. Featuring over 100 objects including the work of artists such as Andreas Gursky, Rachel Whiteread and Giles Round, it will consider the perspectives of those who use buildings to live in and heal, as well as those who design them.</p>
<p>At a time when more and more people live in metropolitan areas, <em>Living with Buildings </em>will look back at the impact of urbanisation on sanitation in Victorian London and the creation of suburbs and garden cities for the wealthy. Purpose built towns, such as Bournville in Birmingham and Saltaire near Bradford, reveal the motives of philanthropic factory owners.</p>
<p>Concepts of home, from the high-rise Pepys estate in Deptford to the model village of Poundbury in Dorset, will be explored alongside post-war efforts to find a new modern way of living. Archive photographs and footage of experimental health clinics in Peckham and Finsbury will reflect on attempts to improve the health and living conditions of the poor, with a focus on community and prevention.</p>
<p>The exhibition will also look at healing spaces such as smallpox tents and small cottage infirmaries, as well as schemes for twentieth century and contemporary hospitals. Plans and photographs of Aalvar Aalto’s sanatorium in Paimio, Finland, will show how he was guided by the requirements of tuberculosis patients and considered the building a medical instrument in and of itself. In the UK, Maggie’s Centres also emphasise the importance of environment, with each unique building designed to create a supportive space for those living with cancer.</p>
<p>The first floor gallery will be devoted to a major commission developed by architectural practice Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners (RSHP), chosen from an open call to create an full scale project for the exhibition. The commission will comprise a mobile clinic, developed for and with Doctors of the World, in response to the urgent need for effective, adaptable healthcare in emergency situations and remote locations.</p>
<p>A new book by Iain Sinclair, inspired by the exhibition, will be published by Wellcome Collection and Profile Books in September 2018. In<em> Living with Buildings</em> Sinclair embarks on a series of journeys – through London, Mexico, Marseilles and the Outer Hebrides – to explore the conflicted relationships between sickness and structure. Iain Sinclair is the bestselling author of London Orbital, The Last London and Hackney, That Rose-Red Empire.</p>
<p>Living with Buildings opens at Wellcome Collection on 04 October 2018 until 03 March 2019 and is curated by Emily Sargent.</p>

"4085","/press/shortlist-revealed-wellcome-book-prize-2018","Shortlist revealed for Wellcome Book Prize 2018","<p><br /><br />
	The shortlist for the 2018 Wellcome Book Prize is announced, celebrating the best new books that illuminate our encounters with health, medicine and illness. Of the six titles on the list, five are written by women and five are debuts.</p>
<ul><li><em>Stay With Me </em>by Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀ (Nigeria) Canongate Books</li>
<li><em>The Butchering Art</em> by Lindsey Fitzharris (USA) Allen Lane, Penguin Press</li>
<li><em>With the End in Mind </em>by Kathryn Mannix (UK) William Collins, HarperCollins</li>
<li><em>To Be a Machine</em> by Mark O’Connell (Ireland) Granta Books</li>
<li><em>Mayhem: A memoir</em> by Sigrid Rausing (UK/Sweden) Hamish Hamilton, Penguin Books</li>
<li><em>The Vaccine Race</em> by Meredith Wadman (USA/Canada) Doubleday, Transworld</li>
</ul><p>Chaired by artist and writer Edmund de Waal, this year’s judging panel have selected a rich and varied shortlist – one novel, one memoir and four non-fiction books – connected by our complex relationship with mortality. The titles explore bereavement, loss and the fragility of life, consider medical innovations developed to escape death, and reflect on why we should talk more about dying.</p>
<p>Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀’s heart-breaking debut <em>Stay with Me </em>is the only novel shortlisted for the prize. It offers an insight into fertility, family and the devastating effects of sickle-cell disease in 1980s Nigeria. The shortlisted memoir, <em>Mayhem</em> by Sigrid Rausing, uses the author’s own experience to explore the power of addiction and the impact this has on loved ones.</p>
<p>This year’s non-fiction titles chart the past, present and future of scientific progress. Lindsey Fitzharris evokes the grisly world of Victorian surgery, as Joseph Lister brings centuries of savagery, sawing and gangrene to an end in <em>The Butchering Art</em>. Meredith Wadman takes us into the 20th century in <em>The Vaccine Race</em>, presenting the game-changing story of the rubella vaccine breakthrough that has since protected hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Mark O’Connell looks to the future in <em>To Be a Machine</em>, investigating and questioning the transhumanism movement and the aim of using technology to extend life and push the human body beyond its current limitations.</p>
<p>The final title on the shortlist is a tender and insightful exploration of one of society’s major taboos. Palliative care consultant Kathryn Mannix makes a compelling case for approaching death not with trepidation but with openness, clarity and understanding in <em>With the End in Mind</em>.</p>
<p>The list celebrates new voices with five debuts: <em>Stay With Me</em> (Adébáyọ̀), <em>The Butchering Art </em>(Fitzharris), <em>With the End in Mind </em>(Mannix), <em>To Be a Machine</em> (O’Connell) and <em>The Vaccine Race</em> (Wadman). Authors from the UK, Ireland, USA, Nigeria and Canada are in the running alongside the first Swede to make a Wellcome Book Prize shortlist (Sigrid Rausing). Two titles are from independent publishers: Canongate and Granta Books.</p>
<p>The winner will be revealed at an evening ceremony on Monday 30 April at Wellcome Collection.</p>
<p>Edmund de Waal commented on behalf of the judging panel: “The demand of judging the Wellcome Book Prize is to find books that have to be read, books to press into people’s hands, books that start debates or deepen them, that move us profoundly, surprise and delight and perplex us, that bring the worlds of medicine and health into urgent public conversation: books that show us what it is to be human. These are six powerful books to read and share.”</p>
<p>Kirty Topiwala, Publisher at Wellcome Collection and Wellcome Book Prize Manager, said: “Year on year this genre continues to excel. These six exceptional books brilliantly demonstrate the variety, style and power of contemporary writing engaged with health and the human experience.”</p>
<p>Quotes from the judging panel on the 2018 Wellcome Book Prize shortlist:</p>
<p>Edmund de Waal on <em>Stay With Me</em> by Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀: “<em>Stay with Me</em> by Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀ is a remarkable and turbulent novel that sweeps the reader into the heartbreak of infertility and societal expectation. It is funny and heartbreaking in turn, and I loved it.”</p>
<p>Hannah Critchlow on <em>The Butchering Art</em> by Lindsey Fitzharris: “A gruesome yet spellbinding account of how Joseph Lister transformed medicine. A fantastically evocative book guiding the reader through this revolutionary time for medicine.”</p>
<p>Edmund de Waal on <em>With the End in Mind</em> by Kathryn Mannix: “Kathryn Mannix writes with an unparalleled knowledge of palliative care, with compassion and with an urgency to make dying part of our lives. She tells their stories with an utter conviction that ‘it’s time to talk about dying’.”</p>
<p>Sumit Paul-Choudhury on <em>To Be a Machine </em>by Mark O’Connell: “Mark O’Connell goes from the sublime to the ridiculous in <em>To Be a Machine</em> – deftly skewering those who think the answer to humanity’s frailty is to leave it behind, in a book which itself manages to be simultaneously hilarious, touching and utterly humane.”</p>
<p>Bryony Gordon on <em>Mayhem: A memoir</em> by Sigrid Rausing: “A breathtaking account of addiction and its effects on families. Sigrid Rausing’s book is powerful and searing without ever feeling exploitative; her writing is spare and honest, asking questions that many would be too frightened to.”</p>
<p>Sophie Ratcliffe on<em> The Vaccine Race</em> by Meredith Wadman: “A book with an unlikely hero – a humble collection of cells, derived from an aborted fetus, without the mother’s consent. Wadman’s brilliantly researched book unfolds like a thriller, but asks some tough ethical questions along the way.”</p>

<p>Art, science and somewhere in between. Wellcome Collection presents four collaborations by contemporary artists and the scientists they worked with.</p>
<p>Bringing together installations by Martina Amati, Daria Martin, Maria McKinney and John Walter, the exhibition considers how artists can give shape to the human experience, provoking ideas about our senses, our sexual health, our bodies’ limitations and reflections on our food chain.</p>
<p>In today’s often fragmented society, Somewhere in Between shows how working together makes it possible to find solutions, challenge individual perspectives and find new ways of thinking. The artists featured in the exhibition integrate current research from the fields of physiology, neuroscience, immunology and genetics in their work.</p>
<p>The featured works are recent projects selected from the rich range of arts projects funded by Wellcome, which has supported the arts for two decades as part of its work to encourage conversations about science and health. They are being presented at Wellcome Collection for the first time.</p>
<p>The artists and works featured are:</p>
<p><strong>Martina Amati,<em> Under</em>, 2015</strong> – This multiscreen installation explores freediving: the act of going underwater with no breathing apparatus – which defies the rational and challenges scientific explanation. Inspired by Amati’s childhood experiences of growing up by the sea, Under takes the visitor on a journey through the immensity of the ocean and into this meditative and mysterious landscape to explore the outer limits of what a human body can achieve. Amati developed the research for the films in partnership with anaesthetist Professor Kevin Fong.</p>
<p><strong>Daria Martin, <em>Sensorium Tests</em> and <em>At the Threshold</em>, 2012</strong> – Daria Martin’s films delve into the experience of mirror-touch synaesthesia, a newly discovered neurological condition that causes people feel the sensation of what another person is touching. To create these films, Martin worked with cognitive neuroscientist Michael Banissy and people with lived experience of mirror-touch. These poetic 16 mm films open up ideas about the extended possibilities of human connection and empathy, questioning how sensations might be created and shared between people and objects.</p>
<p><strong>Maria McKinney, <em>Sire</em>, 2016</strong> – Sire looks at genetics in cattle breeding and presents ideas about the past and the future of humanity’s efforts to shape nature. McKinney researched the project with geneticist David MacHugh and veterinary scientist Michael Doherty alongside Irish farming communities. Comprising a series of large photographic portraits of bulls wearing intricately woven sculptures inspired by genomics, and corn dollies as symbols of good luck and fertility, Sire contemplates the hidden systems beneath beef and milk production.</p>
<p><strong>John Walter, <em>Alien Sex Club</em>, 2015</strong> – Designed to explore the relationship between visual culture and HIV today, this large-scale installation draws visitors in using colour, humour and hospitality. Comprising sculpture, painting, video and performance, Alien Sex Club is laid out in the style of a ‘cruise maze’ found in sex clubs and gay saunas. Walter developed the project with infectious diseases consultant Alison Rodger and sexual health service providers, and it is intended to provide people with a new and different vocabulary for thinking and talking about the transmission of HIV.</p>
<p>Somewhere in Between runs at Wellcome Collection from 8 March 2018 until 27 August 2018. It is curated by Laurie Britton Newell.</p>

"4079","/press/bbc-radio-4-launch-survey-loneliness-collaboration-wellcome-collection","BBC Radio 4 launch survey into loneliness in collaboration with Wellcome Collection","<p><br /><br />
	The Loneliness Experiment is an online survey which will explore the nation’s attitudes and personal experiences. It aims to find out the factors that contribute to loneliness, the role of relationships, connection and social media, and what has aided recovery or improvements to wellbeing.</p>
<p>The survey has been developed by academics at the University of Manchester, Brunel University London and the University of Exeter, with the aid of a grant from Wellcome, in the hope it will increase understanding of one of the major issues facing society today.</p>
<p>In 2015, 18,000 people took part in the Radio 4 and Wellcome Collection’s Rest Test which explored the nation’s resting habits. With thousands of people expected to complete the Loneliness Experiment, it is likely to be the largest survey of its kind, providing important insights into subjective experiences of loneliness across the UK and beyond.</p>
<p>The survey will explore areas such as:</p>
<ul><li>At which times of life are people most likely to feel lonely?</li>
<li>What is the role of friendship?</li>
<li>Do an individual’s personality and life circumstances affect their experience of loneliness?</li>
<li>How does new technology and social media affect loneliness?</li>
<li>How do we view people who are lonely?</li>
<li>What solutions have people found the most (and least) useful when it comes to tackling their own loneliness?</li>
<li>What is the opposite of loneliness?</li>
</ul><p>People are invited to take part, whether or not they have experienced loneliness. The aim of the project is to increase understanding around prevention, as well as examining the solutions people have found most useful.</p>
<p>The survey takes less than 40 minutes to complete, and those who participate will be able to see instant feedback online, tracking some of the results so far.</p>
<p>Claudia Hammond, presenter of Radio 4’s All in the Mind explains: “We’ve heard a lot about loneliness in the news recently with the Jo Cox Commission and the appointment of a Minister for Loneliness. It’s clear that loneliness has been brought into focus, but there’s a lot that is still unknown about it. We want as many people as possible to take part in the Loneliness Experiment to help discover not only who is likely to feel lonely, but what it is that can propel people out of it and help them feel more connected to others.""</p>
<p>Pamela Qualter, Professor of Psychology at the University of Manchester who is leading the study, says: ""Loneliness is at the forefront of many people’s minds, and is being discussed in the media almost every day. We want to explore how it may be linked to mental health, and whether there is any relationship, for good or bad, between loneliness and internet use. We are also keen to know if there is still a stigma surrounding loneliness. We hope that the results will provide us with a clear picture of what life is like for lonely people at different ages in the UK and beyond"".</p>
<p>The results will be analysed and announced in the autumn at an event in the Reading Room at Wellcome Collection and broadcast on All in the Mind on BBC Radio 4. There will also be a Radio 4 series Anatomy of Loneliness and a set of specially commissioned dramas.</p>

"4076","/press/teeth-forthcoming-exhibition-wellcome-collection","TEETH: Forthcoming exhibition at Wellcome Collection","<p><br /><br />
	From vampires and tooth fairies to barber-surgeons and professional dentists, Wellcome Collection’s summer exhibition will trace the evolution of our relationship with our teeth and what they say about us. Opening in May 2018, TEETH will feature over 150 objects, including cartoons and caricatures, protective amulets, toothpaste advertisements and a range of chairs, drills and training tools.</p>
<p>TEETH will be the first exhibition to chart the history of the profession that has shaped the way we live with, or without, our teeth. It will draw on the rich collections assembled by Henry Wellcome, alongside loans from key Northern European collections including the substantial holdings of the British Dental Association in London.</p>
<p>Exploring the origins of dentistry, and the emergence of the smile, the exhibition will feature the first scientific treatise on teeth. Le Chirugien-Dentiste (the Surgeon-Dentist), 1728, by Pierre Fauchard, will be displayed with examples of early techniques, tools and dentures made from hippopotamus ivory.</p>
<p>Examples of tooth care for the wealthy will include the hygiene set used by Queen Victoria’s dentist, dentures belonging to King William IV and Napoleon’s toothbrush. The barber-surgeons and blacksmiths who performed extractions for the less privileged will be depicted in paintings, with caricatures by Thomas Rowlandson contrasting the suffering of the poor with the ostentatious smiles of the wealthy as they display new, gleaming dentures.</p>
<p>Emerging technologies in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a more industrialised approach to tooth care. The exhibition will chart the changing availability and affordability of consumer products such as toothpastes and brushes, as well as the evolution of dental drills, the use of x-rays and the advent of anaesthetic. Giant mouths and oversized teaching tools from the collections of the University Of Utrecht, Netherlands, will reveal techniques for training dentists, who had to practise on large models before moving to the intricacy of working inside a human mouth.</p>
<p>TEETH will explore the idea of oral hygiene as a right and a responsibility. Poster campaigns, films and animations will show the ways in which we have been encouraged to look after our teeth, with protective routines to prevent decay. The exhibition will also look at how adverts for tooth care have had to compete against those for sugar-rich products.</p>
<p>Fears and anxieties around teeth and dentistry have long existed. Ancient Roman votives and 19th century amulets thought to protect against pain will be shown alongside images of St Apollonia, the patron saint of tooth pain who was martyred after having her teeth shattered. The very particular relationship children have with the gaining and losing of teeth will be revealed, showing how different families assist the work of the tooth fairy, and how parents, dentists and new technologies can help combat anxiety.</p>
<p>As the only visible part of the human skeleton, teeth are intrinsically linked to identity, both individual and cultural. From the lengths some will go to for a Hollywood smile, to the providing of vital forensic clues in the aftermath of warfare or natural catastrophe, our teeth say a lot about who we are. The exhibition will consider the language we use around teeth, such as gnashing them, gritting them or lying through them, and will examine the tensions surrounding tooth-care, whether for health, comfort or confidence.</p>
<p>TEETH will run from 17 May to 16 September 2018 and is curated by James Peto, with Emily Scott Dearing. The exhibition is inspired by The Smile Stealers by Richard Barnett, published by Wellcome Collection and Thames & Hudson. </p>

	Wellcome Collection invites proposals from architects, engineers, designers and artists for a full scale commission as part of a major exhibition exploring the pivotal role of architecture in human health.</p>
<p>Opening in October 2018, Living with Buildings will chart how shifts in thinking and approaches to design have impacted on our health and wellbeing. From the bold experiments of urban post-war town planners to the considerately crafted healing spaces for cancer sufferers, the exhibition will look anew at the buildings that surround and shape us. The exhibition will take place in Wellcome Collection’s ground floor gallery.</p>
<p>Alongside the exhibition, Wellcome will commission a ‘live build’ 1:1 architectural project for its first floor gallery. The commission concept must explore a key issue or health concern and how it might be addressed with design. This could include, but is not limited to: climate change; pollution; dementia; infectious disease; obesity and shelter housing.</p>
<p>Submissions will be assessed by a panel comprising: Sadie Morgan, founding director of de Rijke Marsh Morgan Architects (dRMM); Jeremy Myerson holder of the Helen Hamlyn Chair of Design at the Royal College of Art; Vanessa Norwood, Head of Exhibitions at the Architectural Association; Emily Sargent, Senior Curator of temporary exhibitions at Wellcome Collection and Paul Wilkinson, clinical epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</p>
<p>The commission should form part of an already developed research project related to health, and there will be opportunities to display background research and concepts alongside the structure. It must be suitable for use within a museum environment, and speak to broad and diverse audiences not necessarily familiar with the field of contemporary architecture.</p>
<p>The competition deadline is 02 February 2018. Further information is available on <a href=""/architectural-commission-open-call"">Wellcome Collection’s website</a>.</p>

<p>Wellcome Collection today announces its acquisition of a 17th century portrait of businesswoman and celebrity Barbara van Beck. The painting is a rare depiction in oil paint of a woman living with a genetic condition resulting in excessive hair growth on the body.</p>
<p>The work has been acquired by Wellcome Collection, the free museum and library for the incurably curious. It joins five existing prints of the same woman which are held in the Collection. The painting enhances an already extensive array of portraits of individuals living with various health conditions from across centuries.</p>
<p>The painting, dating from the 1640s, is an authentic record of a person living with a rare congenital endocrine condition, most likely hypertrichosis, also called Ambras syndrome. It is one of the earliest depictions, along with those of the Gonzales family, of a person living with a condition in which the face and often much of the body is covered with hair. It depicts Van Beck wearing an expensive silk gown, with a low neckline emphasising her femininity whilst also being very fashionable for its time.</p>
<p>Barbara van Beck was born Barbara Ursler near Augsburg, Bavaria, in 1629. She married Johan Michael van Beck from the Netherlands, who became her manager and they had one child. She travelled extensively throughout Europe, including to London at least twice, once as a child and again in 1657 when writer, diarist and gentry gardener, John Evelyn (1620-1706) recorded seeing her at a show with other high-class performers. He described her hair as ‘thick and even as growes on any womans head.’ He also recounts how she was neatly dressed, ’very well shaped,’ and how she ‘played well on the Harpsichord.’ Evelyn was a good friend of Samuel Pepys, who also documented a woman in London with a similar condition some years later.</p>
<p>Dr Angela McShane, Research Development Manager, Wellcome Collection, said: ‘It’s difficult to imagine what it must have been like to live with a condition such as this 350 years ago, but it’s also too easy to make assumptions based on today’s social and medical norms. We know that Barbara van Beck was a successful public figure, renowned internationally, and that she turned this condition to her advantage. There’s so much more to understand about this work, and by making it available to a wider audience we hope not just to further our understanding of the very different social and medical context of this period, but also to challenge ourselves to think about life, health and our place in the world.’</p>
<p>The portrait of Barbara van Beck will be available to view at Wellcome Collection, London, in early 2018. It will also be showcased in a major conference on the Culture of Beauty to be held at Wellcome Collection in Autumn 2018.</p>

<p>Science, art, or somewhere in between? Wellcome Collection’s major spring exhibition will showcase the work of four contemporary artists and the scientists they collaborated with. Bringing together installations by Martina Amati, Daria Martin, Maria McKinney and John Walter, the exhibition will consider how artists can give shape to the human experience, provoking ideas about our senses, our sexual health, our bodies’ limitations and reflections on our food chain.</p>
<p>The artists featured in the exhibition integrate current research from the fields of physiology, neuroscience, immunology and genetics in their work. In today’s often fragmented society, Somewhere in Between will show how working together makes it possible to find solutions, challenge individual perspectives and find new ways of thinking. The featured works are recent projects selected from the rich range of arts projects funded by Wellcome, which has supported the arts for two decades as part of its work to encourage conversations about science and health. They are being presented at Wellcome Collection for the first time.</p>
<p>The artists and works featured are:</p>
<p><strong>Martina Amati, Under, 2015</strong> – This multi-screen installation explores freediving: the act of going underwater with no breathing apparatus – an act which defies the rational, and challenges scientific explanation. Inspired by Amati’s childhood experiences of growing up by the sea, Under takes the visitor on a journey through the immensity of the ocean and into this meditative and mysterious landscape to explore the outer limits of what a human body can achieve. Amati developed the research for the films in partnership with an anaesthetist Professor Kevin Fong.</p>
<p><strong>Daria Martin, Sensorium Tests and At the Threshold, 2012</strong> – Daria Martin’s films delve into the experience of mirror-touch synaesthesia, a newly-discovered neurological condition where people feel the sensation of what another person is touching. To create these films, Martin worked with cognitive neuroscientist Michael Banissy and people with lived experience of mirror-touch. These poetic 16 mm films open up ideas about the extended possibilities of human connection and empathy, questioning how sensations might be created and shared between people and objects.</p>
<p><strong>Maria McKinney, Sire, 2016</strong> – Sire looks at genetics in cattle breeding and presents ideas about the past and the future of humanity’s efforts to shape nature. McKinney researched the project with geneticist David MacHugh and veterinary scientist Michael Doherty, alongside Irish farming communities. Comprising a series of large photographic portraits of bulls wearing intricately woven sculptures inspired by genomics and corn dollies as symbols of good luck and fertility, Sire contemplates the hidden systems beneath beef and milk production.</p>
<p><strong>John Walter, Alien Sex Club, 2015</strong> – Designed to explore the relationship between visual culture and HIV today, this large-scale installation draws visitors in using colour, humour and hospitality. Comprising sculpture, painting, video and performance, Alien Sex Club is laid out in the style of a ‘cruise maze’ found in sex clubs and gay saunas. Walter developed the project with infectious diseases consultant Alison Rodger and sexual health service providers, and it is intended to provide people with a new and different vocabulary for thinking and talking about the transmission of HIV.</p>
<p><em>Somewhere in Between</em> runs at Wellcome Collection from 8 March 2018 until 27 August 2018. It is curated by Laurie Britton Newell.</p>

"4048","/press/ayurvedic-man-encounters-indian-medicine-opens-wellcome-collection","Ayurvedic Man: Encounters with Indian medicine opens at Wellcome Collection","<p><br /><br />
	Tradition and modernity come together in Wellcome Collection’s new exhibition. <em>Ayurvedic Man: Encounters with Indian medicine</em> shines a light on Wellcome’s rich historical collections, displaying a new artist commission and a series of never-seen-before letters.</p>
<p>With a focus on Indian medicine and Ayurveda, a centuries-old but evolving set of medical practices translating to ‘the knowledge of long life’, the exhibition features Sanskrit, Persian and Tibetan manuscripts, vibrant gouache paintings, erotic manuals and animal-shaped surgical tools. It takes its title and inspiration from a unique 18th century Nepalese painting that shows the organs and vessels of the male body according to classical Ayurveda.</p>
<p>Newly unearthed letters from Wellcome’s archives chart eleven years of correspondence to and from Dr Paira Mall. Sent to India in 1911, Mall collected cultural items for Henry Wellcome’s museum and gathered local health knowledge and medicinal plants for the Wellcome Research Laboratories. Framing the exhibition, these letters trace the movement of medical knowledge and museum objects across continents and cultures.</p>
<p>A new commission by artist Ranjit Kandalgaonkar (b.1976) reimagines the outbreak of plague in Bombay in 1896. Drawing the Bombay Plague (2017) depicts some of the unpopular measures imposed by the British colonial administration and a range of local responses. Featuring goddesses, technology, architecture, riots and fleas, Kandalgoankar’s intricate drawing highlights perceptions and misconceptions of disease. The work is accompanied by a digital platform allowing visitors to zoom into the source material from Wellcome Collection’s Library, London, and the Asiatic Library, Mumbai.</p>
<p>From the anatomical to the cosmological, the exhibition features a collection of vivid diagrams and drawings showing various understandings of the human body and the world around it. This includes a Persian watercolour linking body parts to zodiac symbols, a Tibetan body map depicting the chakras, and a Sanskrit manuscript from 1469 exploring the concept of karma.</p>
<p>A Tibetan bloodletting chart and a beautifully crafted ivory enema syringe represent some of the physical and more intrusive procedures involved in Ayurvedic medicine. These are presented with a series of colourful Company School paintings depicting a range of routine practices for maintaining health, including vigorous massage, astrological readings and pulse taking.</p>
<p>The exhibition also explores the tensions between colonial and indigenous medical knowledge. The 12 volume Hortus Indicus Malabaricus (1678–1693) is a monumental work of taxonomy, compiled by a Dutch East India Company commander, drawing on knowledge from scholarly Brahmins and local Ayurvedic physicians. Illustrations of plants used in healing, such as turmeric and pepper, reveal how spices are commercialised, and a new film by Nilanjan Bhattacharya, Quiet Flows the Stream (2017) highlights the delicate balance between sharing and protecting natural resources.</p>
<p>The role of gender and women’s health in Indian medicine is explored through one of the earliest works of Ayurvedic medical literature, the Caraka Saṃhitā, and a collection of objects relating to family planning. This includes a letter from Mahatma Gandhi (1935) and the Ananga Ranga, (Stage of Love), a 15th-century illustrated Indian sex manual.</p>
<p>Curator Bárbara Rodríguez Muñoz says: “At a time when we are fascinated by different approaches to health, <em>Ayurvedic Man</em> reflects on how ‘alternative’ medical practices evolve and the encounters that shape them. The exhibition questions notions of authenticity and reflects on the ownership of heritage, both medical and cultural, all the while examining our own collections and history.”</p>
<p><a href=""/ayurvedic-man""><em>Ayurvedic Man: Encounters with Indian medicine</em></a> runs at Wellcome Collection from 16 November 2017 until 8 April 2018. It is curated by Bárbara Rodríguez Muñoz, with curatorial advisor Sita Reddy.</p>
<p>Ranjit Kandalgaonkar’s commission follows his residency at<a href=""https://www.gasworks.org.uk/""> Gasworks</a>, London, supported by Charles Wallace India Trust and Inlaks Shivdasani Foundation. The exhibition is inspired by Wellcome Collection’s Medicine Corner initiative, a series of activities which took place in India in 2016.</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection is publishing Ayurvedic Man: Encounters with Indian medicine, an exquisite treasury of illustrations and objects, to accompany the exhibition.</p>

	Wellcome Collection, the free museum and library which makes connections between life, medicine and art, today announces its 2018 exhibition programme.</p>
<p>At the heart of the programme is the first major exhibition devoted to the history of teeth, from the grimly-fascinating activities of early dental practitioners to today’s quest for a perfect smile. The programme also includes a focus on how four contemporary artists have collaborated with scientists to explore what it means to be human in the 21st century. In September 2018, Wellcome Collection will examine how we live with and around buildings, and how they affect our physical and mental wellbeing.</p>
<p><strong>Wellcome Collection exhibition programme 2018:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Somewhere In Between: Four Collaborative Projects<br /><br />
	8 March – 27 August 2018 (Press view: 7 March 2018)</strong></p>
<p>In today’s often fragmented society it has never been more important to collaborate to find solutions and challenge perspectives. Somewhere in Between brings together works by four contemporary artists, who have worked together with scientists to explore what lies beneath, beyond and between, and question what it means to be human in the 21st Century.</p>
<p>Martina Amati, Daria Martin, Maria McKinney and John Walter will be examining subjects ranging from synaesthesia to cattle breeding, free diving to HIV. They have each integrated research from the fields of physiology, neuroscience, immunology and genetics.</p>
<p>Each project shares a desire to give shape to things that are elusive and intangible, and to incorporate the human experience at the heart of these complex ideas. Drawn from the rich archives of Wellcome-funded arts projects, these works are being presented at Wellcome Collection for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>TEETH<br /><br />
	17 May – 16 September 2018 (Press view: 15 May 2018)</strong></p>
<p>All human life is reflected in a toothy grin. Wellcome Collection’s major 2018 exhibition will trace the evolution of our relationship with our teeth and with the profession that has shaped the way we live with them - or without them.</p>
<p>Following modern history's tireless pursuit of the pain-free mouth and the perfect smile, this is the first exhibition to look at how dentistry evolved from fairground entertainment to highly-skilled profession with many associated educational campaigns and spin-off industries.</p>
<p>Including beautifully illustrated treatises dating back to the early 18th century, TEETH will draw on the wealth of images, objects and artworks held in the collections assembled by Henry Wellcome, supplemented by loans from key collections in Northern Europe. It will explore oral hygiene and dentistry as markers of medical progress, and vividly illustrate the enduring connections between 'good' teeth, beauty, vanity, wealth and success.</p>
<p><strong>Living with Buildings: Health and Architecture<br /><br />
	4 October 2018 – 3 March 2019 (Press view: 3 October 2018)</strong></p>
<p>Wellcome Collection will examine ways in which architecture and the built environment interact our health and wellbeing in this new exhibition. From the bold experiments of urban post-war town planners to healing spaces for cancer sufferers and fantastic Utopias envisaged by artists, the exhibition will chart how shifts in design and approach have impacted on the health and experience of those who use buildings to live, to heal and to be human.</p>
<p>Living with Buildings will explore how our built environment contributes to our physical and mental health in both positive and negative ways. We spend more time than ever indoors and the approaches of architects, planners and designers can have a powerful influence over our feelings of individual wellbeing and self-esteem; on our community and society; as well as physical health.</p>
<p>At a time when we increasingly spend our time within the structures of our cities, and more and more people live in metropolitan areas, this exhibition will take a fresh look at the buildings that surround us and shape us.</p>
<p>The exhibition will accompanied by a new architectural commission to be announced in early 2018.</p>

"4008","/press/why-music-key-memory-bbc-radio-3-wellcome-collection","Why Music? The Key to Memory with BBC Radio 3 at Wellcome Collection","<p><br /><br />
	Do you sometimes struggle to remember what you did yesterday, but can remember songs from your childhood? Do you get bugged by irritating ‘earworms’ (songs which get stuck in your head)? Music has the power to stimulate, challenge or heighten our experiences; a sequence of notes can evoke times past; music can ‘stick’ in your mind for a lifetime. Why Music? The Key to Memory will be a free weekend of events and broadcasts exploring the relationship between music, memory and the mind which will take place at Wellcome Collection this October in partnership with BBC Radio 3.</p>
<p>The weekend will include ‘Created Out of Mind’, current residents of The Hub – Wellcome’s interdisciplinary research group exploring the relationship between the arts and science. Created Out of Mind are a unique team of artists, scientists and clinicians who are working together over two years at Wellcome Collection to explore dementias and the arts. The team hopes to enrich public perceptions of dementias as affecting more than only memory, to raise provocative questions about the healthy and ageing brain. Their findings will feature across the weekend.</p>
<p>Broadcasting live from Wellcome Collection over a long weekend (13 – 15 October) the public are invited to join BBC Radio 3 as they present a series of programmes around music, memory and the mind. The discussions will cover everything from the power of song in helping people with a dementia, to how conductors learn complicated musical scores and how jazz improvisation works.</p>
<p>Highlights of the weekend will include:</p>
<ul><li>Dr Catherine Loveday will talk about how people’s enduring musical tastes are dictated by the ‘reminiscence bump’ - the period in our lives from which older adults have the strongest recollections (from the age of 15 to 21).</li>
<li>BBC Radio 6 Music and Radio 3 join forces for a simulcast broadcast presented by Cerys Matthews and Tom Service, coming live from the Henry Wellcome Auditorium and will feature an eclectic mix of music and guests.</li>
<li>A performance from Singing with Friends, a community choir for families living with dementia led by Wigmore Hall in partnership with Westminster Arts, will be broadcast alongside discussions from those involved on the joy of singing together.</li>
<li>Created Out of Mind will talk about how technology has given them insight into the ways choral singing helps people with dementia. • Tom Service will explore ‘earworms’ in his Sunday programme, The Listening Service.</li>
<li>The Early Music Show looks at how music helped monks remember huge swathes of prayer. Manuscripts from the Wellcome collection will be used to illuminate this.</li>
<li>A special six-hour ‘slow radio’ night sequence will use music to bind together the voices of people living with dementias as they talk about their concerns and lives.</li>
</ul><p>Visitors will be able to book tickets for the broadcast discussions and there will be a drop in events including in-gallery interactions to explore music, memory and the mind, pop-up activities and a look at improvisation and memory.</p>
<p>Why Music? The Key to Memory will be broadcast on Radio 3 and will also be available on iPlayer for 30 days.</p>
<p>All of the events are free. Most of the events are ticketed and tickets will be available to book from Friday 29 September at: <a href=""/whymusic"">https://wellcomecollection.org/whymusic</a></p>

	Wellcome Collection presents the first major exhibition exploring the relationship between graphic design and health. Comprising some 200 objects including hard-hitting posters, flashing pharmacy signs, and iconic pill packaging, <em>Can Graphic Design Save Your Life?</em> considers the role of graphic design in constructing and communicating healthcare messages around the world and shows how it continues to be used to persuade, inform and empower.</p>
<p>Drawn from public and private collections around the world, the exhibition highlights the widespread and often subliminal nature of graphic design in shaping our environment, our health and our sense of self. It features work from influential figures in graphic design from the 20th century, as well as from studios and individuals working today.</p>
<p><em>Can Graphic Design Save Your Life?</em> opens with flags showing the emblems of the Red Cross, the Red Crescent and the Red Crystal. Rarely displayed together, they are some of the world’s most recognisable, powerful and highly protected symbols, used to depict neutrality and provide safety in conflict zones.</p>
<p>The exhibition considers the persuasive strategies employed in shaping public perceptions around smoking. Luxuriant advertising campaigns such as those employed by Silk Cut in the 1980s are displayed alongside objects showing the transition to plain packaging and anti-smoking imagery found in formats as small as postage stamps from around the world. It also reveals the imaginative educational approaches taken to instruct us about our bodies, from 16th century anatomical pop-up books to the Tiny Bop learning app, as well as Planned Parenthood comic books advocating safe sex.</p>
<p>The role of design in informing and orienting people in hospitals is explored through the use of signage and fonts, as well as resources that help to identify and communicate different types of pain. Colourful schemes for children’s wards, designed by Studio Rubio Arauna, Studio Rejane Dal Bello and Studio Myerscough, in Barcelona, Peru and London respectively, further demonstrate how graphics can be used to transform the hospital experience and improve patient wellbeing in settings traditionally considered as intimidating or unpleasant.</p>
<p>Items from the archive of Burroughs Wellcome & Co., one of the first companies to market directly to doctors and to rigorously enforce trademarks and brand, provide some of the earliest examples of corporate identity in the pharmaceutical industry. Further studies include the iconic Bayer identity and the influence of the pioneering and modernist design studio at Geigy. The exhibition also considers how graphic designers deliver clear healthcare instructions to consumers through carefully designed colour coding systems, written instructions and pill packaging.</p>
<p>The front-line response in battling epidemics continues to be crucial in global health. From Italian renaissance plague notices to a hand painted mural depicting Ebola symptoms during the 2014 outbreak in West Africa, graphics provide an immediate and important way to convey information as medical crises unfold. Further examples include Abram Games’ anti malaria poster, the AIDS: Don’t Die of Ignorance Campaign from the 1980s, and a mosquito-killing billboard used in Brazil to raise awareness of Zika.</p>
<p>The final part of the exhibition considers how graphic design can empower people and provoke an individual response. Exploring the principles of Ken Garland’s First Things First manifesto, which called for graphic designers to use their skills for good, this section features several impactful campaigns. This includes the Scottish Government’s 2009 Kill Jill poster that significantly increased organ donation rates and the Samaritan’s award-winning Network Rail We Listen advertisements.</p>
<p>Selected works include those by Fritz Kahn, Abram Games, Marie Neurath, F.H.K. Henrion, Karl Gerstner, Margaret Calvert, Dan, Reisinger, Dick Bruna, Ken Garland, Alan Kitching and Biman Mullick. Current established studios represented will include Pentagram, Studio Dumbar, PearsonLloyd, and Kenya Hara’s Hara Design Institute. Further studios and individuals whose work is on show include Henrik Kubel, Poulin + Morris, Stockholm Design Lab, Astrid Stavro and Nick Bell.</p>
<p><em>Can Graphic Design Save Your Life?</em> is curated by graphic designer Lucienne Roberts and design educator Rebecca Wright, founders of publishing house GraphicDesign&, with Shamita Sharmacharja at Wellcome Collection.</p>

"3956","/press/ayurvedic-man-encounters-indian-medicine-upcoming-exhibition-wellcome-collection","Ayurvedic Man: encounters with Indian medicine upcoming exhibition at Wellcome Collection","<p><br /><br />
	Wellcome’s rich historic collection of South Asian objects takes centre stage in a new exhibition opening in November 2017. <em>Ayurvedic Man: encounters with Indian medicine </em>will feature Sanskrit, Persian and Tibetan manuscripts, vibrant gouache paintings, erotic manuals and animal-shaped surgical tools. These will be shown alongside never-seen-before letters from Wellcome’s archives, which trace the movement of medical knowledge and museum objects across continents and cultures.</p>
<p>The exhibition’s title piece is a unique 18th century Nepalese painting showing the organs and vessels of the male body according to Ayurveda, a centuries-old, but ever evolving, set of medical practices translating to ‘the knowledge of long life’. Further understandings of the human anatomy will be illustrated in a series of vivid diagrams and drawings, including a Persian watercolour linking body parts to zodiac symbols and a Tibetan body map depicting the chakras.</p>
<p>From the corporeal to the cosmological, <em>Ayurvedic Man</em> examines the continuities and ruptures between tradition and modernity. It will reveal newly unearthed correspondence to and from Dr Paira Mall, who was sent to India in 1911 to collect cultural and historical objects for Henry Wellcome’s museum, and local health and botanical knowledge for the potential development of pharmaceutical products. Framing the exhibition, these letters reflect on periods of exchange and collaboration, conflict and exploitation, as well as issues central to the ownership of heritage.</p>
<p>Public health policies of the British colonial administration had a major impact on the development of Indian medicine. Documents relating to the science of smallpox inoculation, engravings of colonial hospital buildings and photographs documenting plague prevention measures outline the tensions between authorities and local communities, empire and colony.</p>
<p>A new commission by artist Ranjit Kandalgaonkar (b.1976), currently in residence at Gasworks, London, will interrogate the responses to the outbreak of plague in Bombay in 1896. The work will comprise a detailed drawing that reimagines the events that took place, along with an interactive digital platform which will allow visitors to zoom into additional material from Wellcome Collection’s Library, London, and the Asiatic Library, Mumbai.</p>
<p>Encounters between colonial and indigenous botanical knowledge will be represented by an edition of the 12 volume Hortus Indicus Malabaricus. Compiled between 1678–1693 by a commander of the Dutch East India Company, this monumental work of taxonomy draws on knowledge from scholarly Brahmins and local physicians, and is still relevant to modern biodiversity. The exhibition will also show drawings of plants used in Ayurvedic healing, including those that led the spice trade explorations such as turmeric and pepper.</p>
<p><em>Ayurvedic Man </em>will include extracts from one of the foundational texts of Ayurveda, the Susruta Samhita, one of the earliest works of Indian medical literature. This compendium outlines medical procedures including bloodletting and rhinoplasty, or nasal reconstruction, that predate modern surgery, and will be displayed alongside surgical instruments. A range of other practices including enemas, vigorous massage, dietetics and intense yoga postures, will be depicted in a series of colourful Company School paintings. These will be shown with an intricately carved enema syringe from Sri Lanka, emphasising the intimate yet intrusive nature of some of these methods.</p>
<p>The role of gender in Indian medicine is explored through a collection of objects relating to childbirth and family planning, including an early erotic manuscript and a gouache painting depicting the mythological story of a bird recommending a caesarean section. The exhibition will also feature photographs of women doctors and midwives in the early twentieth century, and a letter from Mahatma Gandhi (1935) outlining his opinion on birth control.</p>
<p>At a time of growing popularity of pluralistic approaches to health, societies around the world are at increasing risk of losing natural resources, medicinal plants and traditional knowledge. Ayurvedic Man highlights the delicate balance between sharing and protecting heritage, cultural resources and environmental biodiversity.</p>
<p>Ayurvedic Man: encounters with Indian medicine runs at Wellcome Collection from 16 November 2017 until 8 April 2018. It is curated by Bárbara Rodríguez Muñoz, with advice from Sita Reddy. Ranjit Kandalgaonkar’s commission follows his residency at <a href=""https://www.gasworks.org.uk/residencies/ranjit-kandalgaonkar-2017-07-03/"">Gasworks</a>, London, supported by Charles Wallace India Trust and Inlaks Shivdasani Foundation. The exhibition is inspired by Wellcome Collection’s <a href=""/medicinecorner"">Medicine Corner</a> initiative, a series of activities which took place in India in 2016.<br /><br /><br /><br />

<p><strong>BBC Radio 3 joins forces with Wellcome Collection this autumn for three days of live music, discussion, one-off programmes and events.</strong></p>
<p>Do you sometimes struggle to remember what you did yesterday, but can remember songs from your childhood? Do you get bugged by irritating ‘earworms’ (songs which get stuck in your head)? Music has the power to stimulate, challenge or heighten our experiences; a sequence of notes can evoke times past; music can ‘stick’ in your mind for a lifetime. Why Music? The Key to Memory will be a free weekend of events and broadcasts exploring the relationship between music, memory and the mind which will take place at Wellcome Collection this October in partnership with BBC Radio 3.</p>
<p>The weekend will include ‘Created Out of Mind’, current residents of The Hub – Wellcome’s interdisciplinary research group exploring the relationship between the arts and science. Created Out of Mind are a unique team of artists, scientists and clinicians who are working together over two years at Wellcome Collection to explore dementias and the arts. The team hopes to enrich public perceptions of dementias as affecting more than only memory, to raise provocative questions about the healthy and ageing brain. Their findings will feature across the weekend.</p>
<p>Broadcasting live from Wellcome Collection over a long weekend (13-15 October) the public are invited to join BBC Radio 3 as they present a series of programmes around music, memory and the mind. The discussions will cover everything from the power of song in helping people with a dementia, to how conductors learn complicated musical scores and how jazz improvisation works.</p>
<p>Highlights of the weekend will include:</p>
<ul><li>Dr Catherine Loveday will talk about how people’s enduring musical tastes are dictated by the ‘reminiscence bump’ - the period in our lives from which older adults have the strongest recollections (from the age of 15 to 21).</li>
<li>BBC Radio 6 Music and Radio 3 join forces for a simulcast broadcast presented by Cerys Matthews and Tom Service, coming live from the Henry Wellcome Auditorium and will feature an eclectic mix of music and guests.</li>
<li>A performance from Singing with Friends, a community choir for families living with dementia led by Wigmore Hall in partnership with Westminster Arts, will be broadcast alongside discussions from those involved on the joy of singing together.</li>
<li>Created Out of Mind will talk about how technology has given them insight into the ways choral singing helps people with dementia.</li>
<li>Tom Service will explore ‘earworms’ in his Sunday programme, The Listening Service.</li>
<li>The Early Music Show looks at how music helped monks remember huge swathes of prayer. Manuscripts from the Wellcome collection will be used to illuminate this.</li>
<li>A special six-hour ‘slow radio’ night sequence will use music to bind together the voices of people living with dementias as they talk about their concerns and lives.</li>
</ul><p>Visitors will be able to book tickets for the broadcast discussions and there will be a drop in events including in-gallery interactions to explore music, memory and the mind, pop-up activities and a look at improvisation and memory.</p>
<p>Why Music? The Key to Memory will be broadcast on Radio 3 and will also be available on iPlayer for 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>All of the events are free. Most of the events are ticketed and tickets will be available to book from Friday 29 September at: <a href=""/whymusic"">wellcomecollection.org/why-music</a> </strong></p>

	Wellcome Collection’s new exhibition is made up of objects borrowed from members of the public. Open from 22 June 2017, ‘A museum of modern nature’ reveals the intriguing and surprising ways we relate to the natural world in modern life.</p>
<p>From a hand painted garden gnome passed through three generations of the same family, to the asthma inhaler that sparked a career in environmentalism or the tattoo inspired by phytoplankton, each object tells a unique and personal story. Together the diverse items on display provide a collective snapshot of how we think about nature in the 21st century, and explore how our behaviours and values are bound up with the future of the planet.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
<ul><li>Childhood books and a fallow deer antler contributed by two of the presenters of BBC Springwatch, Michaela Strachan and Chris Packham</li>
<li>A pair of running shoes, a slice of bread and a thermos flask are examples of the everyday objects that bring nature into people’s lives, routines and memories</li>
<li>Coffins for dead crabs made by teenagers, and a recording of the dawn chorus in Kenya show the ways in which nature is a source of inspiration and imagination</li>
<li>A paper knife in the shape of a fish, made in the trenches of World War One, highlights the human impetus to create art and meaning even, or especially, in times of suffering</li>
<li>A fluffy yellow toy chick and some realistic astroturf demonstrate the ubiquity of synthetic versions of natural things, and hint at an anxiety over declining resources</li>
<li>Contributors to the exhibition range in age from two-and-three-quarters (an axe made from a stick) to 91 years old (childhood family photograph). With each decade in between represented, the objects span many different experiences and perspectives.</li>
</ul><p>The objects were selected by a small team of people, including a dairy farmer, a horticultural scientist and a plant medicine shaman, who all work with nature in their daily lives. Their objects, from binoculars, to a jar of their own milk teeth and a jar of country air, will also be on show.</p>
<p>The exhibition also features an art work created in collaboration between year 9 students at Central Foundation Boys’ School and artist Verity-Jane Keefe. A contemporary take on a museum diorama, the work is the result of a series of workshops and explores what nature means for boys who live in inner London, and what it might look like in the future.</p>
<p>A major digital project, <a href=""https://sharingnature.wellcomecollection.org/"">Sharing Nature</a>, runs alongside the exhibition to showcase images and ideas suggested by the public from across the country and beyond. Using a different theme each week, each and every one of these digital offerings are displayed in the gallery as well as online forming a broad picture of our everyday relationship with nature in 2017.</p>
<p>Exhibition curator, Honor Beddard, says: “We asked our visitors what should be in a museum of modern nature and their response was incredible; we’re delighted to be able to share just some of their playful and provocative objects in this exhibition. The items themselves may seem commonplace, but the stories behind them are moving, thought-provoking, funny and almost always surprising. Gathered together and placed on display these objects offer a different way of looking at the natural world, and may help us to visualise the links between how we live our lives and the future health of the planet.”</p>
<p>The exhibition will run from 22 June until 08 October 2017 and is curated by Honor Beddard, with bespoke design by Install Archive. Following on from <em>Making Nature: How we see animals</em> the exhibition is the culmination of a year-long exploration of our relationship with the natural world.</p>
<p>To accompany the yearlong programme, Wellcome Collection has published Animal Vegetable Mineral, a collection of nature charts, maps and diagrams with an introduction by Tim Dee.</p>

<p>Mend the Living by Maylis de Kerangal and translated by Jessica Moore has been named as the winner of the 2017 Wellcome Book Prize. This year’s Chair of Judges, Val McDermid, made the announcement at an award ceremony at Wellcome Collection, London.</p>
<p>Maylis de Kerangal is the first French author to win the prestigious prize, which celebrates exceptional works of fiction and non-fiction that engage with the topics of health and medicine and the many ways they touch our lives.</p>
<p>Mend the Living is the first novel in translation to be awarded the £30,000 prize, translated from French into English by the Canadian translator Jessica Moore. It is the second time a novel has been recognised in the prize’s history.</p>
<p>The judging panel praised Maylis de Kerangal’s beautiful style in this exploration of the emotional, physical and practical complexities of organ donation, reflecting the fragility and fluidity of life.</p>
<p>Concentrated across the span of a single day, Mend the Living is a heart-breaking and gripping story of life-saving medical science: a 24-hour whirlwind of trauma and death, life and hope. It tells the story of Simon Limbeau’s heart, from the car accident that leaves him brain-dead and on life support, to the moment when Simon’s heart begins to beat again in the body of someone else.</p>
<p>On 28 April, celebrated French director Katell Quillévéré’s adaption of Mend the Living – called Heal the Living (Réparer les vivants) – will be screened in UK cinemas, featuring a stellar French cast including Tahar Rahim, Emmanuelle Seigner and Anne Dorval. The film has received excellent reviews, and was praised by Guy Lodge at Variety for blending “dazzling formal polish with rawest emotion”.</p>
<p>Mend the Living was chosen as the winner of the 2017 Wellcome Book Prize from a shortlist of six books: How to Survive a Plague by David France, When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi, The Tidal Zone by Sarah Moss, The Gene by Siddhartha Mukherjee and I Contain Multitudes by Ed Yong.</p>
<p>It is the first time a title from MacLehose Press has won.</p>
<p>As Mend the Living is a novel in translation, the £30,000 prize money will be divided with two thirds awarded to the author and one third to the translator.</p>
<p>Val McDermid commented on behalf of the judging panel: “Mend the Living is a metaphorical and lyrical exploration of the journey of one heart and two bodies. Over 24 hours we travel from trauma to hope, discovering both the humane aspect of organ donation and the internal dramas of those affected by it. Compelling, original and ambitious, this novel illuminates what it is to be human.”</p>
<p>Kirty Topiwala, Publisher at Wellcome Collection and Wellcome Book Prize Manager, said: “The quality of submissions for the 2017 Wellcome Book Prize has been exceptionally high, and we are thrilled that the judging panel has chosen Mend the Living as our winner. Not only it is an incredibly powerful and emotionally affecting novel – beautifully translated by Jessica Moore – but it offers a valuable insight into organ donation, and brings new understanding to the lives touched by the transplant process.”</p>

<h2>NOTES TO EDITORS</h2>
<p><strong>About Mend the Living</strong></p>
<p>Mend the Living by Maylis de Kerangal, translated by Jessica Moore (MacLehose Press)</p>
<p>Just before dawn on a freezing winter’s morning, three young men head out to the sea and go surfing. But on the drive home, their van suddenly veers off the road and one of them, Simon Limbeau, is propelled through the windscreen. At the hospital, Simon’s devastated parents are told that while he is brain-dead and on life support, his heart is still beating perfectly and could be recovered for use in a transplant. They are faced with an agonising choice.<br>‘Mend the Living’ is the story of Simon Limbeau’s heart – and the story of all the lives it will impact in the 24 hours between the accident that cuts short his life and the moment when his heart will begin to beat again in the body of someone else.</p>
<p>Maylis de Kerangal (49, France) spent her childhood in Le Havre, France. Her novel Birth of a Bridge was the winner of the Prix Franz Hessel and Prix Médicis in 2010. Her novella Tangente vers l’est was the winner of the 2012 Prix Landerneau. In 2014, her fifth novel, Mend the Living, was published in French to wide acclaim, winning the Grand Prix RTL-Lire award and being declared the Student Choice Novel of the Year by France Culture and Télérama.</p>
<p>Jessica Moore is an award-winning translator, songwriter and poet. She lives in Montreal.</p>

"3833","/press/wellcome-collection-announces-first-exhibition-devoted-graphic-design-and-health","Wellcome Collection announces first exhibition devoted to graphic design and health","<p> </p>
<p>The first major exhibition exploring the relationship between graphic design and health will open at <a href=""/wellcomecollection.org/"">Wellcome Collection</a> in September 2017. Comprising some 200 objects including hard-hitting posters, flashing pharmacy signs, and digital teaching aids, '<a href=""/exhibitions/WZwh4ioAAJ3usf86"">Can Graphic Design Save Your Life?</a>'<em> </em>will consider the role of graphic design in constructing and communicating healthcare messages around the world and will show how graphic design has been used to persuade, to inform and to empower. </p>
<p>This exhibition will highlight the widespread and often subliminal nature of graphic design in shaping our environment, our health and our sense of self. Drawn from public and private collections around the world, it will feature work from influential figures in graphic design from the 20th century, as well as from studios and individuals working today.</p>
<p>'Can Graphic Design Save Your Life?' considers the persuasive strategies employed in shaping public perceptions around smoking, featuring luxuriant advertising campaigns from the 1980s alongside objects showing the impact of plain packaging and anti-smoking imagery found in formats as small as postage stamps. It will also reveal the imaginative educational approaches taken to instruct us about our bodies, from 16th century anatomical pop-up books to 21st century apps, through to comic books advocating safe sex.</p>
<p>The role that design plays in informing and orientating people in medicalised spaces will also be explored. These include the use of brightly coloured design schemes in children’s wards to transform the hospital experience and improve patient wellbeing in settings traditionally considered to be intimidating and unpleasant.</p>
<p>The exhibition will cover corporate identity in the pharmaceutical industry, beginning with items from the archive of <a href=""/wellcomecollection.org/what-we-do/introducing-henry-wellcome"">Burroughs Wellcome & Co</a>. which was the first to employ strategies such as direct marketing to doctors and rigorous enforcement of trademarks and brand. Further studies will include the iconic Bayer identity and the influence of the pioneering and modernist design studio at Geigy. Furthermore, it will consider how graphic designers deliver clear healthcare instructions to consumers through carefully designed colour coding systems, written instructions and pill packaging.</p>
<p>The front-line response in battling epidemics continues to be crucial in global health. Renaissance plague notices and Victorian quarantine bills will be displayed alongside global public health campaigns sparked by the emergence of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and Ebola and Zika in Africa and Brazil respectively in the last few years. Such examples reveal the immediacy and importance of graphics in conveying information as medical crises unfold.</p>
<p>The final part of the exhibition will consider how graphic design can empower people and provoke an individual response. Inspired by a contemporary reimagining of Ken Garland’s<em> First Things First</em> manifesto (1964), which called for fellow graphic designers to employ their skills in aid of public benefit, this section will include powerful campaigns focussed on raising awareness of breast cancer, and complex conditions such as dementia, as well as raising organ donation rates.</p>
<p>Selected works include those by Fritz Kahn, Abram Games, Marie Neurath, F.H.K. Henrion, Karl Gerstner, Margaret Calvert, Dick Bruna and Ken Garland. Current established studios represented will include Pentagram, Studio Dumbar, PearsonLloyd and Kenya Hara’s Hara Design Institute. Further studios and individuals whose work is on show include Studio Myerscough, Poulin + Morris, A2/SW/HK, Studio Rubio Arauna, Studio Rejane Dal Bello, Stockholm Design Lab, Astrid Stavro and Nick Bell.</p>
<p>'Can Graphic Design Save Your Life?' is curated by graphic designer Lucienne Roberts and design educator Rebecca Wright, founders of publishing house GraphicDesign&, with Shamita Sharmacharja at Wellcome Collection.</p>

"3821","/press/weekend-collecting-wellcome","A weekend of collecting at Wellcome ","<p> </p>
<p>Wellcome Collection is looking for objects, ideas and stories as part of a summer exhibition that will reveal the many and varied ways that we relate to the natural world in modern life. Members of the public are invited to bring items that represent their own personal connections to nature over a weekend festival of collecting, talks and activities at Wellcome Collection, with appearances from the BBC’s Springwatch team, 4-7 May 2017.</p>
<p>The <a href=""/events/remaking-nature"">Re-making Nature weekend</a> will see visitors having their objects captured on camera and recording the unique stories behind them, building up a picture of how the things we keep and use reflect our ideas about the world around us.</p>
<p>A selection of the objects brought in over the weekend will be chosen by curators and guest experts to go on display in a new exhibition at Wellcome Collection, opening 22 June 2017. The exhibition, titled '<a href=""/wellcomecollection.org/exhibitions/museum-modern-nature"">A museum of modern nature</a>', is the culmination of a year-long exploration of our relationship with the natural world. It will examine the idea of a museum of nature in the 21st century, asking what it might contain, what purpose it would serve and whether we should put nature in a museum at all.</p>
<p>Exhibition curator Honor Beddard says: “Nature means different things to different people. We’re excited to shine a light on the everyday objects in our homes and daily lives, asking what these can tell us about nature and how this connects to the bigger picture of the health of our planet. We hope that the objects and stories that are selected for 'A museum of modern nature' will be surprising, moving, funny and perhaps sad, and that ultimately they reveal a modern story of nature as told by the public.”</p>
<p>A major digital project will run alongside the exhibition to showcase images of all the objects suggested by visitors, and continue to crowdsource further ideas and contributions. Members of the public from all across the country, and beyond, will be asked to send in their nature-related stories and objects using a different theme each week. These digital offerings will be available to view in the gallery as well as online, forming a broad snapshot of our everyday relationship with nature in 2017.</p>
<p>The exhibition will run from 22 June until 10 September 2017 and is curated by Honor Beddard, with design by Lee Reagan. Following on from '<a href=""/wellcomecollection.org/MakingNature"">Making Nature: How we see animals</a>' (until 21 May), which examines the origins of how humankind relates to other species, '<a href=""/wellcomecollection.org/exhibitions/museum-modern-nature"">A museum of modern nature</a>' will ask what it is that connects us to, and causes us to care for, nature today. To accompany the exhibition, Wellcome Collection has published <a href=""http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/bookshop/product/Animal-Vegetable-Mineral-Organising-Nature-A-Picture-Album/9780957028593""><em>Animal Vegetable Mineral</em>,</a> a collection of nature charts, maps and diagrams with an introduction by <a href=""http://timdee.com"">T</a>im Dee.</p>

"3757","/press/major-commissions-unveiled-wellcome-collection%E2%80%99s-electrifying-exhibition","Major commissions unveiled for Wellcome Collection’s electrifying exhibition","<p> </p>
<p>Wellcome Collection today unveils three new commissions inspired by the theme of electricity. The artists John Gerrard, Camille Henrot and Bill Morrison have each created the works as part of a major exhibition in London, 'Electricity: The spark of life', which traces the story of mankind’s quest to understand, unlock and master the power of electricity. The exhibition brings together over 100 objects from ancient spark-inducing amber and early electrostatic generators to radiographs, photographs, models and films.</p>
<p>John Gerrard has created a new live simulation inspired by 18th-century experiments on amputated legs of dead frogs. Camille Henrot’s installation takes the form of a zoetrope featuring creatures hand-crafted from electricity bills. Bill Morrison has created a work using mid-20th-century graphic films with an original score by composer Bill Frisell.</p>
<p><em>X. laevis (Spacelab) </em>2017 by Irish artist John Gerrard (b. 1974, Ireland) is a live simulation using new technology which responds to Luigi Galvani’s pioneering 18th-century experiments on the amputated legs of dead frogs. Inspired by Henry Wellcome’s collection of Galvani’s laboratory equipment and the book in which Galvani published his findings, Gerrard lets the absent frog take centre stage. The work represents an experiment that occurred more than 200 years after Galvani, during the second mission of the space shuttle Endeavour in 1992. The experiment established that vertebrates, in the form of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), could reproduce in zero gravity.</p>
<p>Camille Henrot’s (b.1978, France) new installation, <em>January 2017 Horoscope</em> 2017 (mixed media) takes the form of a zoetrope. As the mechanism rotates, a frog, a cardinal butterfly and other animals hand-crafted from electricity bills are animated, folding and unfolding. Meanwhile, life-sized hands each spark a lighter to ignite an electricity bill, alluding to a state of exhaustion arising from a never-ending excess of spending and consumption. The work is inspired by the holdings of Teylers Museum in Haarlem which has a rich collection of objects relating to early experiments with and applications of electricity.</p>
<p>In <em>Electricity </em>2017 (16 mm film transferred to HD, 30 mins), Bill Morrison (b.1965, USA) has created an animated world which explores the production and distribution of electricity and its impact on our daily lives. This abstract film brings together footage from 130 technical, educational and commercial films from the mid-20th century. The films, held in the Electricity Council archive at the Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester, were originally made to prepare the public for the ubiquitous presence of electricity in their households and daily lives. Morrison has worked with his frequent collaborator, the guitarist and composer Bill Frisell who has created an original score, to make a film which reflects on who we are as energy-dependent beings with interconnected lives across the planet.</p>
<p>Electricity: The spark of life runs 23 February – 25 June 2017 at Wellcome Collection and is accompanied by a full programme of events at the museum. It is curated by Lucy Shanahan and Ruth Garde, Wellcome Collection, with Consultant Curator and Exhibition Originator Paul Bonaventura. The exhibition has been produced in collaboration with Teylers Museum, Haarlem, Netherlands and the Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester, UK. Following its presentation at Wellcome Collection it will travel to both venues from summer 2017 onwards.</p>
<p>To coincide with the exhibition a new publication, A Practical Course in Personal Magnetism, has been published by Wellcome Collection and Profile Books, £7.99 Hardback and eBook.</p>

	The longlist for the 2017 Wellcome Book Prize is announced today, Monday 30 January. The prize celebrates exceptional works of fiction and non-fiction that engage with the topics of health and medicine and the many ways they touch our lives.</p>
<p>The 2017 longlist of 12 books was selected by a judging panel chaired by celebrated Scottish crime writer Val McDermid, alongside Simon Baron-Cohen, Gemma Cairney, Tim Lewens and Di Speirs.</p>
<p>The full 2017 Wellcome Book Prize longlist is:</p>
<ul><li>How to Survive a Plague (Picador, Pan Macmillan) by David France (USA) non-fiction</li>
<li>Homo Deus (Harvill Secker, Penguin Random House) by Yuval Noah Harari (Israel) non-fiction</li>
<li>When Breath Becomes Air (The Bodley Head, Penguin Random House) by Paul Kalanithi (USA) non-fiction</li>
<li>Mend the Living (MacLehose Press) by Maylis de Kerangal (France) trans. Jessica Moore fiction</li>
<li>The Golden Age (Europa Editions) by Joan London (Australia) fiction</li>
<li>Cure (Canongate Books) by Jo Marchant (UK) non-fiction</li>
<li>The Tidal Zone (Granta Books) by Sarah Moss (UK) fiction</li>
<li>The Gene (The Bodley Head, Penguin Random House) by Siddhartha Mukherjee (USA) non-fiction</li>
<li>The Essex Serpent (Serpent’s Tail, Profile Books) by Sarah Perry (UK) fiction</li>
<li>A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived (Weidenfeld & Nicolson) by Adam Rutherford (UK) non-fiction</li>
<li>Miss Jane (Picador, Pan Macmillan) by Brad Watson (USA) fiction</li>
<li>I Contain Multitudes (The Bodley Head, Penguin Random House) by Ed Yong (UK) non-fiction</li>
</ul><p>Comprising seven non-fiction and five fiction titles, the longlist includes memoir, contemporary fiction, historical fiction and popular science. Authors from the UK and USA appear, alongside the first Australian, French and Israeli contenders for the £30,000 prize. From the impact of unexplained childhood illness on families (The Tidal Zone) and the reality of living with a congenital anomaly in early 20th-century Mississippi (Miss Jane), through the story of a heart transplant taking place over 24 hours (Mend the Living), to the 40 trillion microbes contained in the human body (I Contain Multitudes), the longlist highlights the incredible breadth and depth of our encounters with medicine.</p>
<p>Historic moments of medical progress are brought to life, with titles examining the Victorian conflict between science and religion (The Essex Serpent), the 1950s polio epidemic in Australia (The Golden Age) and the role of activism in overcoming the 1980s AIDS crisis (How to Survive a Plague). The longlist also includes an examination of research into the mind’s ability to influence our health (Cure) and looks to the not-too-distant future, envisioning the next stage of evolution (Homo Deus).</p>
<p>Two debut books appear on this year’s longlist: I Contain Multitudes by Ed Yong and When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi, whose life-affirming reflection on facing our mortality is the first posthumously published title to be recognised by the Wellcome Book Prize. Mend the Living by Maylis de Kerangal and Jessica Moore is the first translated text to be included.</p>
<p>The three previously shortlisted authors in the running for the prize are Adam Rutherford (Creation, 2014), Siddhartha Mukherjee (The Emperor of All Maladies, 2011) and Sarah Moss, who is in contention for the third consecutive year (Bodies of Light, 2015; Signs for Lost Children, 2016).</p>
<p>Four independent publishers appear on the list: Canongate, Granta, Europa Editions and Serpent’s Tail.</p>
<p>Val McDermid commented on behalf of the judging panel: “The challenge of judging the Wellcome Book Prize is that we have all had to read outside our own areas of expertise. That makes demands both of the judges and of the books. This longlist is evidence of the breadth, humanity and creativity at work in the submissions for the prize, and we commend each of these 12 books for your reading pleasure.”</p>
<p>Kirty Topiwala, Publisher at Wellcome Collection and Wellcome Book Prize Manager, said: “We were deluged with submissions for the prize this year and so are delighted to be reintroducing a longlist for the 2017 Wellcome Book Prize and celebrating even more of these superb books. This is an extremely strong longlist, characterised by the trademark eclecticism of the prize – each of these books grapples uniquely and eloquently with complex, moving and profoundly human subjects.”</p>
<p>The shortlist for the prize will be announced at a press conference on Tuesday 14 March at the London Book Fair. The winner will be announced at an evening ceremony on Monday 24 April at Wellcome Collection.</p>

"3705","/press/spend-night-company-wild-ones-crick-crack-club-wellcome-collection","Spend a night in the company of the wild ones with the Crick Crack Club at Wellcome Collection","<p> </p>
<p>Do you know where your wild side hides? And how do you respond when wildness makes its presence felt? On 3 February 2017 storytelling promoters extraordinaire, The Crick Crack Club, beckons you into a world of clanking bells, flying fur, fairy tales and folklore, for a truly wild late night spectacular at Wellcome Collection.</p>
<p>The Crick Crack Club will bring together story, song, music, film, art, foraged food and an all-female urban tribe to explore both the archaic and contemporary figure of the Wild Man. This mythical and often menacing carnival creature can still be found all over Europe and is the untidy grandfather of Santa Claus. We all seek a place to be wild, and for one night only, artists, speakers and roving wild men will help you venture further into this exciting, intoxicating and alarming world.</p>
<p>The soundtrack to the evening will come from the inaugural concert of ‘Wild Company,’ a group that brings professional storytellers together with an untamed community choir to remix fragments of folk legend and contemporary pop songs. In the presence of five newly constructed Wild Men, both performers and the audience will be challenged to question the presence of a wildness within themselves.</p>
<p>Although the Wild Man is clearly a masculine archetype, visitors will also encounter a modern day all-female urban tribe of wild women, Haus of Sequana. Dressed in spectacular costumes, the tribe seek to escape from typical gender identities and visitors will find themselves ‘interrupted’ by the tribe or involved in their rituals. Wild Folk are often covered in hair or dressed in bizarre and colourful rags, disguises which allow them to cross the borders between human and animal, civilised and uncivilised.</p>
<p>From tales of the goat-riding princess, Tatterhood, to Bearskin and Iron John, performance storytellers will transport visitors on a journey of folklore, metaphor and imagination. Expert talks will probe the existence of wildness within our modern society, with discussions on feral children, a personal story of yetis and an introduction to the neuroscience of fear and the fascination with monsters. Visitors can also roam the galleries and quiz experts on bearded women and the anthropology of homelessness – a lifestyle that, like wild men, challenges cultural norms.</p>
<p>If all the wild food, songs and talks aren’t enough to lure you to your wild side, artist Sophie Herxheimer will illustrate visitors’ most wild experiences. Cult drawing salon, Art Macabre will host a ‘death drawing’ session - a twist on the usual form of life drawing - that celebrates the gothic and dark side of life using a gloriously hairy Mary Magdalene model as inspiration.</p>
<p>Crick Crack Club’s Artistic Director, Ben Haggarty said: “Through this late night event at Wellcome Collection, the Crick Crack Club is embarking on a celebration of the re-emergence of the Wild Man as a truly dynamic icon. We want to provoke our audience to explore both the attraction and repulsion that human wildness evokes, and to question our relationship with the presence of this within ourselves.”</p>
<p>This is a special late-night event with a bar running all night. The majority of activities are drop-in but some talks and activities require booking. Online booking opens on Friday 27 January at 11.00. The building might be busy and space is limited, so entry is not guaranteed. Wellcome Collection’s major winter exhibition, Making Nature: How we see animals, will be open throughout the night.</p>

<p>The Sick of the Fringe presents a weekend festival of theatre, performance and ideas exploring the connections between health and art in London from 17-19 February 2017. From subversive hip hop to sound therapy to drag cabaret, over 30 events will take place across four central London venues: Wellcome Collection, Camden People’s Theatre, Conway Hall and The Place.</p>
<p>Following two successful summers championing science and medicine at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, The Sick of the Fringe (TSOTF) is expanding to bring its unique collaborative programming to new places and spaces, to spark debate in the heart of London.</p>
<p>TSOTF London will feature a diverse line-up of Fringe artists old and new whose work places the human body, with all its problems and possibilities, front and centre stage. Performers including Jess Thom (Tourette’s Hero), Le Gateau Chocolat and FK Alexander will entertain and provoke with shows, talks, music and workshops inspired by health, illness and everything in between.</p>
<p>At Wellcome Collection, a new commission from sequin-clad satire artists Bourgeois & Maurice will explore sex and drug-resistant infections, using musical comedy and guest experts. Objects in the Medicine Man gallery will be subject to a post-colonial critique by Kim Bowers, aka Busty Beatz of Hot Brown Honey, a standout show from 2016’s Edinburgh Festival Fringe. With the Fringe itself turning 70 this year, seven comedians spanning seven decades, from 14-year-old Grace the Former Child to octogenarian Lynn Ruth Miller, will each have seven minutes to talk about growing old disgracefully.</p>
<p>Commissioned by Wellcome, TSOTF London is conceived by artist, performer and Wellcome Engagement Fellow Brian Lobel. It is co-directed by Tracy Gentles of In Company Collective, who have developed and produced the programme.</p>
<p>Brian Lobel said: “The performances and conversations in The Sick of the Fringe are all at once overwhelming, disparate, funny, traumatic and sexy, just like our human bodies can be. We are thrilled to be coming to London, opening exciting possibilities for performers and allowing ideas to thrive in new ways and new spaces.”</p>
<p>Other highlights include a musical about depression My Beautiful Black Dog by Brigitte Aphrodite, Liz Richardson’s solo show Gutted based on her experience living with colitis, and a comedy about incontinence, Gusset Grippers, from pelvic health physiotherapist Elaine Miller.</p>
<p>TSOTF will also run events aimed at performers, including Starring Your Pain, which will feature an expert panel discussing the implications for making autobiographical work about health, trauma or the body.</p>
<p>David Cahill Roots, Arts Manager at Wellcome, said: “In just two years The Sick of the Fringe has built an enviable reputation for bringing together artists and audiences for the most wide-ranging conversations about health. But the Edinburgh Fringe shouldn’t be the only place you can find the likes of Gusset Grippers alongside Bourgeois & Maurice. Bringing the spirit of the festival to London gives us another chance to hear these unique and vital voices.”</p>
<p>TSOTF London runs from 17–19 February 2017 at Wellcome Collection, Conway Hall, The Place and Camden People’s Theatre.</p>
<p>The full programme is available from <a href=""http://thesickofthefringe.com/"">The Sick of the Fringe website</a>.</p>
<p>Events at Wellcome Collection are free but some are ticketed. Tickets can be booked from the <a href=""/sickofthefringe"">event page</a> from 27 January.</p>

"3625","/press/open-wellcome-collection-making-nature-how-we-see-animals","Open at Wellcome Collection - 'Making Nature: How we see animals'","<p> </p>
<p>1 December 2016 – 21 May 2017</p>
<p>The question of how humans relate to other animals has captivated philosophers, anthropologists, scientists, ethicists and artists for centuries. 'Making Nature: How we see animals' brings together over 100 objects from literature, film, taxidermy and photography to examine what we think, feel and value about other species and the consequences this has for the world around us. Featuring works by contemporary artists including Allora & Calzadilla, Phillip Warnell and Abbas Akhavan, the exhibition asks how and why we look at animals and what we see when we do.</p>
<p>From the formalisation of natural history as a science, through the establishment of museums and zoos, to lavish contemporary wildlife documentaries, Making Nature reveals the hierarchies in our view of the natural world, and considers how these influence our actions, or inactions, towards the planet. The exhibition, organised around four themes: ‘Ordering’, ‘Displaying’, ‘Observing’ and ‘Making’, opens with Marcus Coates’ <em>Degreecoordinates, Shared traits of the Hominini (Humans, Bonobos and Chimpanzees)</em> 2015. This recent work questions the definitions of difference between species, establishing this as an idea that runs throughout the exhibition.</p>
<p>Attempts to categorise the natural world in the 18th century are introduced through the work of Carl Linnaeus and the publication of <em>Systema Naturae</em> in 1735. His efforts to record, describe and classify the animal kingdom, solved the practical problem of identifying species but introduced a manmade ranking system. Similarly, Charles Bonnet’s <em>Scale of Natural Beings</em> 1783 provided a ladder of the animal kingdom with humans placed at the top. Such views are challenged by the depictions of animals, and human-like animals, in Jonathan Swift’s satire of man, <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>.</p>
<p>'Making Nature' questions the approach of ‘learning through looking’, including artists such as herman de vries, a trained botanist interested in the challenge of objectivity and Edwina Ashton who explores the politics of representation. The importance of listening is also examined by artists Allora & Calzadilla in <em>The Great Silence</em> 2014. This film installation is a depiction of endangered parrots paired against footage of the Arecibo Observatory, one of world’s largest telescopes, in Puerto Rica.</p>
<p>The exhibition also charts changing fashions of museum displays alongside society’s changing attitudes to nature, from overstuffed cabinets in Victorian institutions to elaborately staged dioramas from natural history museums in the 20th century. Roger Fenton’s 1855 image of an unnaturally upright gorilla skeleton next to a human one, taken during his time as the British Museum’s documentary photographer, interrogates the idea that natural history displays may not necessarily represent an objective truth. Contemporary photographers Richard Ross and Hiroshi Sugimoto, expose the complexities of successive attempts to give visitors an authentic representation of the animal in a museum setting, revealing works of art as yet another form of mediation.</p>
<p>The search for an authentic encounter with nature is further examined through our ever more ambitious attempts to get closer to animals, in zoos, national parks and on screen, while simultaneously hoping to preserve their wildness. <em>The New Architecture and The London Zoo</em> 1936, a film by László Moholy-Nagy and images of the zoo’s elephant and rhino pavilion, designed by Casson Condor architects, provide examples of how the designs of zoo enclosures are used to frame animals. The phenomenon of the ‘zoo-pet’, or mascot, is explored through cases like Jumbo the elephant, adored by Victorian audiences and subject of a public outcry when he was sold to P.T. Barnum’s Circus in 1882. Souvenirs and toys will show how zoo animals have frequently been anthropomorphised in popular culture.</p>
<p>Depictions of animals on film include <em>Woodpeckers</em> 1954, the first documentary to use new camera technologies to film a family of woodpeckers from within their nest. When broadcast on the BBC, it was second in popularity only to the Queen’s coronation that year, and set the precedent for natural history documentaries which remain popular today. The exhibition also features an extract from <em>Seal Island</em> 1948, part of Walt Disney’s <em>True-Life Adventures</em> series of nature films promoted as entertainment, as well as Jean Painlevé’s pioneering surrealist film of marine crustaceans from 1929.</p>
<p>Phillip Warnell’s film installation <em>Ming of Harlem: Twenty One Storeys in the Air</em> 2016 explores the true story of Antoine Yates, who lived in a high-rise New York apartment with a tiger called Ming and a large alligator. Combining documentary with recreated scenes, Warnell offers new insights on the human/animal relationship and the question of representation.</p>
<p>The final section of the exhibition is a major collaboration with the Center for PostNatural History, Pittsburgh, USA, the only organisation to solely collect organisms that have been intentionally altered by humans. Specimens, paintings, literature and scientific models, many on loan from the Center’s museum, chart a relationship to animals that is bound up with the history, and future, of human civilisation. This includes the domesticated pigeons that helped inform Charles Darwin’s theories of natural selection and the genetic modification of mosquitos in the fight against disease spread. Further case studies comprise dog breeding, the origins of laboratory mice and rats, and a history of songbirds as told by musicologist Ian Nagoski. Unlike traditional natural history collections, the significance of postnatural organisms lies in the role they play in human culture.</p>
<p>'Making Nature' runs from 1 December 2016 to 21 May 2017 and is the first part of a year-long exploration of our relationship with the natural world. The exhibition is curated by Honor Beddard with exhibition design from AOC. To accompany the exhibition, Wellcome Collection publishes <em>Animal Vegetable Mineral</em>, a collection of nature charts, maps and diagrams with an introduction by Tim Dee.</p>

<p>Wellcome Collection turns 10 in 2017, and today it announces its forthcoming exhibition programme for this special birthday year. Wellcome Collection’s free exhibitions make connections between life, medicine and art. The 2017 programme will celebrate the inventors and scientists who unlocked the natural force of electricity and the graphic designers who have created hard-hitting health campaigns and iconic pill packets. Making Nature continues into its second phase exploring our connection to the natural world, and Henry Wellcome’s own collection comes under the spotlight, illuminating the medical and healing traditions of India.</p>
<h2>2017 Exhibition programme</h2>
<p><strong>'<a href=""/electricity"">Electricity: The spark of life'</a></strong><br /><br />
	23 February – 25 June 2017 (Press view: 22 February 2017)</p>
<p>From the structure of the atom to the function of our brains, an electric charge is hidden within every object on earth. 'Electricity: the spark of life' will trace the story of mankind’s quest to understand, unlock and master the power of electricity. This major exhibition will show how this invisible yet vital force is fundamental to human life and has captivated inventors, scientists and artists alike for centuries. It will feature three new commissions by international artists John Gerrard, Camille Henrot and Bill Morrison, and bring together over 100 objects from ancient spark-inducing amber and early electro-static generators to radiographs, photographs, paintings, models and films.</p>
<p><strong>'Making Nature Part II'</strong><br /><br />
	22 June 2017 - 10 September 2017 (Press view: 21 June 2017)</p>
<p>'Making Nature Part II' is the second part of a year-long exploration into how humans relate to other animals and the world around us: a question that has captivated philosophers, anthropologists, scientists, ethicists and artists for centuries. With contributions from our visitors, this exhibition will consider the idea of a museum of nature. It will examine the many and varied ways we are personally connected to the natural world and the implications this has for the planet. '<a href=""/MakingNature"">Making Nature: How we see animals</a>' continues until 21 May 2017.</p>
<p><strong>'Can Graphic Design Save Your Life?'</strong><br /><br />
	7 September 2017 – 14 January 2018 (Press view: 5 September 2017)</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection’s forthcoming exhibition 'Can Graphic Design Save Your Life?' will explore the important relationship between graphic design and health. From hard-hitting posters to flashing neon pharmacy signs, health promotion to digital self-monitoring apps, this exhibition will focus on the critical and varied role that graphic representation plays in constructing and communicating healthcare messages, and raising awareness of some of the most fundamental aspects of human welfare. The exhibition comprises some 300 objects drawn from the library at Wellcome Collection, the Science Museum and a number of international private collections.</p>
<p>Drawing upon iconic graphic design by past and current graphic designers from across the globe, and featuring extensive and historically rich graphic objects, the exhibition will demonstrate how communication strategies and differing visual languages are employed to persuade, inform, prevent and protect. At a time when epidemics such as the Ebola and Zika viruses, and concerns about obesity and the promotion of healthier lifestyles are at the forefront of public consciousness, the exhibition will highlight the ubiquitous and often subliminal nature of graphic design in shaping our environment, our health and sense of self.</p>
<p>The exhibition is curated by graphic designer Lucienne Roberts and design educator Rebecca Wright, founders of publishing house GraphicDesign&, in collaboration with Wellcome Collection.</p>
<p><strong>'Medicine & Healing in India'</strong><br /><br />

<p>If your body could talk what would it say? Wellcome Collection’s next Friday Late Spectacular, Body Language, 4 November 2016, will be an exciting exploration of the languages of our bodies and what they reveal about our experiences of inhabiting one.</p>
<p>From fat activism to voguing, the entire venue will be given over to a specially curated programme of events that explore the science of self-expression and the politics of identity, highlighting perspectives and voices that are not often heard. Visitors will be able to try their hand at slapstick and sign language, make a zine, and hear from artists, academics and activists, including Dr Charlotte Cooper, Josh Bitelli and Dr Harry Witchel.</p>
<p>Rosie Stanbury, Head of Live Programmes at Wellcome Collection said: “Body Language will dissect every movement, subtlety and signal we make to try to understand the huge variety of languages we communicate in. We’ll be bringing together an exciting range of experts, artists and performers to help us question everything we think we know about what our bodies say about us, before we say a word.”</p>
<p>A talk from fat activist Dr Charlotte Cooper will question what it really means to be healthy, and how this simple term can mask such a complex and fraught area of opinion. A dance performance by Charlotte and her partner Kay Hyatt, further probes the subject of healthy bodies, centring on a sculpture in Wellcome Collection’s Medicine Now Gallery, John Issacs’ I Can’t Help the Way I Feel 2013.</p>
<p>The ground floor of the building will host a mini ball led by voguers from across the vibrant London ballroom scene for an all-encompassing performance complete with DJ and commentator. A dance style that emerged in Harlem in the 1980s, voguing takes body language to the extreme with dramatic movements that celebrate diverse body types and queer identities. A taster session run by pioneering voguer divaD Magnifique will introduce its history as well as providing an opportunity for visitors to throw some shapes.</p>
<p>Visitors can also participate in: a workshop from top fight directors RC Annie exploring the universal language of clowning and slapstick; an immersive BSL class that gives insight into the sophistication and nuance of gesture in sign language, and a zine making session run by artists Collective Creativity that draws on the body of knowledge housed in Wellcome Collection and the Library. </p>
<p>Throughout the venue visitors will encounter specially commissioned performances and activities designed to probe some of the more subtle ways our bodies talk and interact. A multi-platform performance from contemporary artist Josh Bitelli will use sound, gesture and performance to investigate the relay of information between bodies.</p>
<p>No exploration of body language would be complete without a look at some of the professional uses of non-verbal and alternative forms of communication. Taking politicians as a starting point, physiologist Dr Harry Witchel will examine and deconstruct the behaviour we display when presenting and how it can be used to influence others. Researcher Phoebe Caldwell will talk on the alternative languages she has developed to connect to people who have difficulties with more traditional methods of communication. Phoebe has worked extensively with people with autism, mimicking their movements and sound to tune into their unique languages.</p>
<p>‘Body Language’ is curated by Alice Carey and Elsa Richardson. </p>
<p>This is a special late-night event with a bar running all night. The majority of activities are drop-in but some talks and workshops require booking. Online booking opens on Friday 28 October at 11.00. The building might be busy and space is limited, so entry is not guaranteed.</p>

<p><strong>23 February – 25 June 2017 (Press view: 22 February 2017)</strong></p>
<p>From the structure of the atom to the function of our brains, an electric charge is hidden within every object on earth. <a href=""/electricity"">Electricity: The spark of life</a> will trace the story of mankind’s quest to understand, unlock and master the power of electricity.</p>
<p>Opening at Wellcome Collection in February 2017, this major exhibition will show how this invisible yet vital force is fundamental to human life and has captivated inventors, scientists and artists alike for centuries. It will feature three new commissions by international artists John Gerrard, Camille Henrot and Bill Morrison, and bring together over 100 objects from ancient spark-inducing amber and early electro-static generators to radiographs, photographs, paintings, models and films.</p>
<p>Electricity: The spark of life will cover three core themes – generation, supply and consumption. ‘Generation: The Great Invisible’ will show how the history of our enduring fascination with electricity can be traced back to the ancient Greeks and our early encounters with natural wonders, such as a burst of lightning or the mesmerising sight of the Aurora Borealis. It will consider how the late 18th century pioneers and philosophers looked to nature to reveal the physical presence of static electricity, and began to unravel its secrets. This included the study of electric fish, the complex bioelectrical experiments undertaken by Galvani (1737 – 1798), and the development of some of the very first devices designed to generate an electric charge.</p>
<p>Mary Shelley was directly inspired by Galvani’s reanimation experiments and was fascinated by the life-giving and death-dealing potential of electricity. In her renowned gothic novel Frankenstein, of which an early edition will be shown, she describes the awakening of the monster as infused with ‘a spark of being.’ Contemporary artist John Gerrard (b. 1974, Ireland), known for his innovative works in digital media, has also taken inspiration from Galvani in a new commission developed specially for this exhibition.</p>
<p>‘Supply: Wiring the World’ will consider how scientists, inventors and innovators of the 19th century were responsible for harnessing, converting and storing electricity, resulting in a power source that would transform the way we live. Objects will include a voltaic pile (1800-1824) – one of the first batteries – made possible by Allessandro Volta, and ‘Barlow’s wheel,’ an instrument made in 1822 in order to demonstrate how electricity could be converted into movement.</p>
<p>In the late 1880s, the challenge of creating an electrical network resulted in the infamous ‘war of the currents’ involving Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison in the USA. This fierce battle between competing energy companies over the use of direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) raised questions about safety and the transportation of power over large distances. In 1889 London’s first electricity network was established by Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti (1864-1930) who conducted a daring safety test by hammering into a live 10,000 volt cable at the world’s first high-voltage power station in Deptford. The original chisel and section of cable will be displayed alongside maps, satirical cartoons and London Underground posters.</p>
<p>Original photographs from the 1920s will show numerous variations in the design of pylons as they became a feature of landscapes carrying electricity around the world and have subsequently developed an aesthetic appeal. Man Ray’s surrealist Electricité photographs commissioned by the electrical board in Paris in 1931 demonstrate how companies have sought to popularise its use. Contemporary filmmaker Bill Morrison’s new work explores historical footage from the Electricity Council to consider the movement and networks of electricity and its profound interconnectedness with our daily lives.</p>
<p>‘Consumption: the silent servant’ will consider how electricity has come to define the modern world. It will feature a new work by the celebrated artist Camille Henrot, which will consider our energy-dependent lifestyles, as well as the relationship between humans, technology and the environment. This work will be shown alongside early examples of neon lighting and lightbulbs, photographs showing the ‘all-electric house,’ as well as tea towels produced by the Electrical Association of Women in the 1930s offering practical safety advice for the use of electricity in a domestic setting.</p>
<p>Developments in the application of electricity in healthcare will also be explored. This will include early advancements in electrotherapy, one of the first radiographs by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen and advertisements promoting the supposed health-giving effects of electricity through new devices such as ‘electro-belts.’</p>
<p>At a time when we are more reliant on electricity than ever before, the exhibition will ask us to contemplate our ongoing relationship with electricity, the environmental impact of our choices and imagine what the future might look like.</p>
<p>Electricity: The spark of life will run from 23 February – 25 June 2017. It is curated by Lucy Shanahan and Ruth Garde, Wellcome Collection, with guest curator Paul Bonaventura. The exhibition has been produced in collaboration with Teylers Museum, Haarlem, Netherlands and the Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester, UK. Following its presentation at Wellcome Collection it will tour to both venues in summer 2017 and 2018 respectively.</p>

<p><strong>'Making Nature': 1 December 2016 – 21 May 2017 (Press view: 30 November 2016)</strong></p>
<p>The question of how humans relate to other animals has captivated philosophers, anthropologists, scientists, ethicists and artists for centuries. 'Making Nature', opening at Wellcome Collection in December 2016, will bring together over 100 objects from literature, film, taxidermy and photography to examine what we think, feel and value about other species and the consequences this has for the world around us. It will include works by contemporary artists including Allora and Calzadilla and Phillip Warnell and asks how and why we look at animals and what we see when we do.</p>
<p>From the formalisation of natural history as a science, through the establishment of museums and zoos, to lavish contemporary wildlife documentaries, 'Making Nature' will reveal the hierarchies in our view of the natural world, and will consider how these influence our actions, or inactions, towards the planet. The exhibition, organised around four themes: ‘Ordering’, ‘Displaying’, ‘Observing’ and ‘Making’, will open with Marcus Coates’ <em>Degreecoordinates, Shared traits of the Hominini (Humans, Bonobos and Chimpanzees)</em>, 2015. This recent work questions the definitions of difference between species, and will establish this as an idea that runs throughout the exhibition.</p>
<p>Attempts to categorise the natural world in the 18th century will be introduced through the work of Carl Linnaeus and the publication of <em>Systema Naturae</em> in 1735. His efforts to record, describe and classify the animal kingdom, solved the practical problem of identifying species but introduced a manmade ranking system. Similarly, Charles Bonnet’s <em>Scale of Natural Beings</em> 1783 provided a ladder of the animal kingdom with humans placed at the top. Such views are challenged by the depictions of animals, and human-like animals, in Jonathan Swift’s satire of man, <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>.</p>
<p>'Making Nature' will question the approach of ‘learning through looking’, including artists such as herman de vries, a trained botanist interested in the challenge of objectivity and Edwina Ashton who explores the politics of representation. The importance of listening is also examined by artists Allora and Calzadilla in <em>The Great Silence</em> 2014. This film installation is a depiction of endangered parrots paired against footage of the Arecibo Observatory, the world’s largest telescope, in Puerto Rica.</p>
<p>The exhibition will also chart changing fashions of museum displays alongside society’s changing attitudes to nature, from overstuffed cabinets in Victorian institutions to elaborately staged dioramas from natural history museums in the 20th century. Contemporary photographers Richard Ross and Hiroshi Sugimoto, expose the complexities of successive attempts to give visitors an authentic representation of the animal in a museum setting, revealing works of art as yet another form of mediation. Roger Fenton’s 1855 image of an unnaturally upright gorilla skeleton next to a human one, taken during his time as the British Museum’s documentary photographer, interrogates the idea that natural history displays may not necessarily represent an objective truth.</p>
<p>The search for an authentic encounter with nature will be further examined through our ever more ambitious attempts to get closer to animals, in zoos, national parks and on screen, while simultaneously hoping to preserve their wildness. <em>The New Architecture and The London Zoo</em> 1936, a film by László Moholy-Nagy and Casson Condor’s architectural photographs from the 1970s will provide examples of how the designs of zoo enclosures are used to frame animals. The phenomena of the ‘zoo-pet’, or mascot, is explored through cases like Jumbo the elephant, adored by Victorian audiences and subject of a public outcry when he was sold to P.T. Barnum’s Circus in 1882. Souvenirs and toys will show how zoo animals have frequently been anthropomorphised in popular culture.</p>
<p>Depictions of animals on film include, <em>Woodpeckers</em> 1954, the first documentary to use new camera technologies to film a family of woodpeckers from within their nest. When broadcast on the BBC, it was second in popularity only to the Queen’s coronation that year, and set the precedent for natural history documentaries which remain popular today. The exhibition also features an extract from <em>Seal Island</em> 1948, part of Walt Disney’s True-Life Adventures series of nature films promoted as entertainment.</p>
<p>Phillip Warnell’s film installation <em>Ming of Harlem: Twenty One Storeys in the Air</em> 2016 will explore the true story of Antoine Yates, who lived in a high-rise New York apartment with a tiger called Ming and a large alligator. Combining documentary with recreated scenes, Warnell offers new insights on the human/animal relationship and the question of representation.</p>
<p>The final section of the exhibition will be curated in collaboration with the Center for PostNatural History, Pittsburgh, USA, the only organisation to solely collect organisms that have been intentionally altered by humans. Specimens, paintings, literature and scientific models, many on loan from the Center’s museum, will chart a relationship to animals that is bound up with the history, and future, of human civilisation. This includes the breeding of domesticated pigeons by Charles Darwin that helped to inform his theories of natural selection and the genetic modification of mosquitos in the fight against disease spread. Further case studies comprise dog breeding, the origins of laboratory mice and rats, and a history of songbirds as told by musicologist Ian Nagoski. Unlike traditional natural history collections, the significance of postnatural organisms lies in the role they play in human culture.</p>
<p>'Making Nature' will run from 1 December 2016 to 21 May 2017. It is the first part of a year-long exploration of our relationship with the natural world in the past, present and future. The exhibition is curated by Honor Beddard and the exhibition design is by AOC. Wellcome Collection will publish Animal Vegetable Mineral, a book by Tim Dee and Anna Faherty, to accompany the exhibition.</p>

"3549","/press/bedlam-asylum-and-beyond-opens-wellcome-collection","'Bedlam: the asylum and beyond' opens at Wellcome Collection","<p> </p>
<p>Bedlam has long been a byword for chaos. Now a major exhibition at Wellcome Collection opens the doors to the historic asylum from which it derives. Through the lens of the Bethlem Royal Hospital, London, ‘<a href=""/bedlam"">Bedlam: the asylum and beyond</a>’ explores how the experience of mental illness and notions of madness have been shaped over centuries, and imagines what the future might hold.</p>
<p>‘Bedlam’ traces the rise and fall of the asylum and how it has reflected the changing attitudes of the society around it, from the early days of the Bethlem Hospital to the modern, post-asylum world in which prescription medications coexist with an increasing array of other therapies and support options. Visitors encounter scenes from successive incarnations of Bethlem, as well as other models of care from elsewhere in the UK and Europe, revealing how each was founded in an optimistic spirit of humanitarian reform, but abandoned as therapies failed and ideas changed.</p>
<p>Emphasising the lived experiences of individuals, the exhibition features over 150 objects and archival materials, including patient art from Adolf Wölfli, Vaslav Nijinsky and Richard Dadd, alongside works by contemporary artists, including Eva Kot’átková, Shana Moulton, Javier Tellez and the ‘Madlove: A Designer Asylum’ project. A new digital commission for the exhibition by Erica Scourti, Empathy Deck, uses an online mood monitor to generate unique tarot cards, each one offering a healing approach, remedy or thought.</p>
<p>Guest curator, author and historian, Mike Jay says: “Preserved in popular imagination as ‘Bedlam’, the Bethlem Royal Hospital is perhaps the oldest institution of its kind in the world, and has witnessed the entire history of mental illness and psychiatry. Its story is the perfect focus for Wellcome Collection to explore how medicine, art and culture define mental illness, and the big questions it raises about the individual and society.”</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection co-curator Bárbara Rodríguez Muñoz adds: “The perspectives of patients and those with lived experiences of mental distress, as well as those who are blurring the boundaries between art and therapeutic practice, are at the core of this exhibition. At a time when the marketplace of treatment and support options is so broad, but often inaccessible, the exhibition both interrogates and reclaims the idea of the asylum as a place of sanctuary and care.”</p>
<p>‘Bedlam’ opens with a large-scale installation, Asylum, by artist Eva Kot’átková. This 2014 work was inspired by conversations with psychiatric patients and features live performers, evoking the tensions between protection and restraint that thread throughout the exhibition. Visitors are also introduced to the alternative model of care offered by the town of Geel, Belgium, the home of patron saint of mental affliction St Dymphna, where sufferers in the middle ages were taken in by local families and became ‘boarders’, part of the community, a tradition that continues to this day.</p>
<p>The first scene from Bedlam shows Bethlem hospital’s eighteenth century site in Moorfields, as depicted in William Hogarth’s The Rake’s Progress (1763). This section traces how madness was first defined by the law, and reveals how the asylum was open to public visitors, inspiring numerous plays, ballads, poems and artworks. It also features architectural plans for a new Bethlem building by one of the inmates, James Tilly Matthews: the first psychiatric hospital designs by a patient.</p>
<p>Bethlem moved in the 1800s to the building in St George’s Fields, Southwark that now houses the Imperial War Museum. Patient experiences from this era were recorded in poetry, such as Epitaph, of My Poor Jack, Squirrel II, by James Hadfield, and in a quarterly magazine, Under the Dome. The debates around physical restraint from this time are illuminated by Jane Fradgley’s haunting photographs of the quilted garments worn by patients, and definitions of normality are subverted in Javier Tellez’s film installation Caligari and the Sleepwalker (2008), based on the 1920 silent movie, the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (which is currently featured in another Wellcome Collection exhibition: ‘States of Mind: Tracing the Edges of Consciousness’). Photographs by Henry Hering show Bethlem inmates before and after their time in the asylum, as well as the artist Richard Dadd working in his cell while confined as an ‘incurable lunatic’. Dadd turns the patient’s gaze on the doctors with his oil portrait of Bethlem’s governor Alexander Morison (1852).</p>
<p>By the twentieth century, the modern mental hospital had replaced the asylum and redefined mental illness. In 1930 Bethlem moved again to a new site, a villa complex outside the city, and began to incorporate talking and community-based therapies. At this time, patient art was considered both as therapy and a tool for analysis, with several examples shown in this section including Mental Asylum Band-Copse (1910) by Adolf Wölfli, one of the earliest outsider artists. Abandoned Goods, an essay film by Pia Borg and Edward Lawrenson tells the story of over 5500 pieces of patient artwork, now collectively known as the Adamson Collection.</p>
<p>Psychiatry changed rapidly in the twentieth century. The advent of medication as well as other treatment options, and anti-institutional movements such as the democratic psychiatry movement led by Italian Franco Basaglia, coupled with economic pressures, led to residential hospitals being decommissioned. The incongruities of this process are captured in humorous illustrations by Ugo Guarino (1979) alongside a brochure for luxury flats in the former Friern Barnet asylum of north London.</p>
<p>The last section of the exhibition explores the ever-expanding marketplace of treatments and therapies in the post-asylum world, from pharmaceuticals to traditional healing and spirituality, to online support, and artistic therapies. Restless Leg Saga (2012), a film installation by Shana Moulton, depicts a character searching through television and magazine adverts to find relief from her condition, and is shown alongside several examples of pamphlets promoting cross cultural and holistic treatment-guides from the Wellcome Library’s collection. There is a return to Bethlem and Geel in their current incarnations, with a selection of drawings by David Beales, an artist represented by the Bethlem Gallery, that show moments from his time inside psychiatric hospitals, and a collection of photographs by Hugo Minnen that depict boarders going about their daily lives in Geel.</p>
<p>The final work in the exhibition is a special commission of The Vacuum Cleaner and Hannah Hull's Madlove: A Designer Asylum, a collaborative project with designers Benjamin Koslowski and James Christian, illustrator Rosie Cunningham, and over 300 people with lived experience of mental distress who are revisiting and reimagining the asylum as ‘a safe place to go mad’.</p>
<p>‘Bedlam: the asylum and beyond’ runs at Wellcome Collection from 15 September 2016 to 15 January 2017. A parallel exhibition curated by Sam Curtis, ‘Reclaiming Asylum’, is held at the Bethlem Gallery, from 21 September– 11 November 2016.</p>
<p>The institution at the centre of this exhibition; Bethlem Royal Hospital, remains a functioning hospital based in Beckenham and is now part of South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. On the 270 acre site, sits the Bethlem Gallery and Museum, free and open to all.</p>
<p>This Way Madness Lies: The asylum and beyond, a book by Mike Jay produced to accompany the exhibition, is published by Thames & Hudson.</p>

"3479","/press/skeletons-our-buried-bones-tours-uk","Skeletons: Our Buried Bones tours the UK","<p>Monday 15 August 2016</p>
<p>This summer, Wellcome Collection and the Museum of London are collaborating to unearth the stories behind bones from burial grounds across the UK. ‘<a href=""/visit-us/skeletons-our-buried-bones"">Skeletons: Our Buried Bones</a>’ will see skeletons from the Museum of London’s 20,000-strong collection go on a UK-wide tour for the first time, starting at The Hunterian, University of Glasgow, where they will be displayed from 19 August, alongside skeletons from burial grounds in Scotland.</p>
<p>This is a touring exhibition that, after Glasgow, will travel to Bristol and Leeds in 2017, displaying the Museum of London’s skeletons alongside bones discovered locally.</p>
<p>In-depth analysis by experts at the Museum of London has provided insights into the health and history of each individual, helping to bring to life the stories that have long been hidden beneath the ground.</p>
<p>The skeletons on display in Glasgow reflect a rich and varied past, with individuals coming from diverse locations, both geographically and socially, and periods of time. Excavations have uncovered burial grounds across the UK, ranging from the Neolithic period through the Iron Age to Roman London and up to the 19th century. Each individual skeleton reveals aspects of their life and times, including fractures and trauma, multiple myeloma – cancer, the effects of syphilis, rickets or arthritis, and tooth decay.</p>
<p>Emily Sargent, curator at Wellcome Collection, said: ""Spanning thousands of years and from opposite ends of the country and social scales, the bones of these individuals offer us a rare and special glimpse into history. Yet we identify with their rotten teeth or broken bones, and are reminded that skeletons can tell us more about what people lived with, rather than what they died from.""</p>
<p>Sharon Ament, Director of the Museum of London, said: ""This is the first time our skeletons have gone on tour and really shows how museums at opposite ends of the UK can work together to show their joint collections. We can learn a lot from the bones of our ancestors, who all lived through very different versions of the London we know today, and this is a wonderful opportunity to share their stories alongside those of their local Scottish counterparts for the first time.""</p>
<p>Research carried out on the skeletons has helped shed new light on the grounds they were discovered in and the circumstances in which they were buried, from plague pits in urban London to the beaches of South Uist. Specially commissioned photographs by photographer Thomas Adank capture the sites as they are now, and will be displayed in the exhibition next to each skeleton, contextualising them as a reminder of the layers of human history all around us.</p>
<p>Jelena Bekvalac, Curator of Human Osteology at the Museum of London, said: ""Research carried out on these skeletons has given us vital clues into the lives of these individuals, some of whom lived thousands of years ago. Putting them in context with where they were buried and what those sites look like now will mean visitors will have a real, tangible connection to these people. It is a unique opportunity for the skeletons from London to be displayed in Glasgow alongside their Scottish counterparts, and truly demonstrates the rich diversity of burial in the British Isles.""</p>

	Consultant neurologist Suzanne O’Sullivan has been awarded the Wellcome Book Prize 2016 for It’s All in Your Head, her journey through the world of psychosomatic illness, published by Vintage.</p>
<p>The announcement was made by acclaimed author, journalist, broadcaster, and chair of this year’s judges, Joan Bakewell DBE, at a special ceremony held on Monday 25 April, in Wellcome Collection's Reading Room. The £30,000 prize celebrates the best new books, published from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015, that engage with some aspect of medicine, health or illness, showcasing the breadth and depth of our encounters with medicine through exceptional works of fiction and non-fiction.</p>
<p>It’s All in Your Head is O’Sullivan’s first book, a focused look at the range of debilitating illnesses that are medically unexplained. We all exhibit physical responses to emotion – from blushing and laughter, to palpitations and stomach-ache – yet sometimes these expressions can be much more debilitating, causing seizures, paralysis, and even blindness, and the stigmatization associated with such a diagnosis is profound.</p>
<p>As many as a third of people visiting their GP have symptoms that don't appear to have an obvious medical cause. Merging autobiography with absorbing case histories taken from her clinical experience, O’Sullivan’s work spotlights an area of increased attention in medical science – the boundaries between what afflicts the body and the mind and how deeply related the one is to the other.</p>
<p>The 2016 prize was judged by a panel comprising chair Joan Bakewell; Frances Balkwill OBE, Professor of Cancer Biology at Barts Cancer Institute and an author of science books for children; writer, columnist and salonnière, Damian Barr; award-winning novelist, Tessa Hadley; and award-winning journalist and author, Sathnam Sanghera.</p>
<p>Announcing the winner, chair of judges Joan Bakewell, said:</p>
<p>“From a broad field of submissions, including an exceptionally strong shortlist, Suzanne O’Sullivan’s It’s All in Your Head was unanimously chosen as our winner of the Wellcome Book Prize 2016.</p>
<p>It is a truly impressive book, chosen for its many virtues. Suzanne O’Sullivan is a consultant neurologist and her first-hand accounts of diagnosing her patients offer new insights into the relationship between the body and the mind. The fact that society divides them into two medical disciplines - the physical and the mental - is being increasingly challenged. O’Sullivan’s book brings to light important examples of how the two inter-relate.”</p>
<p>Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection, James Peto, said:</p>
<p>“We are delighted that the judges have unanimously chosen to reward the Wellcome Book Prize 2016 to Suzanne O’Sullivan’s absorbing and beautifully written It’s All in Your Head. O’Sullivan’s book is a thoughtful, humane and heartfelt plea for a deeper and more widespread understanding of the intensely debilitating conditions she describes. An honest and revealing exploration of an area of healthcare where there is still much that is not yet known, this book reminds us forcibly of the complexities of the relationship between mind and body, and that the practice of medicine necessarily remains an art as well as a science.”</p>
<p>Suzanne O’Sullivan has been a consultant in neurology since 2004, working first at the Royal London Hospital and today as a consultant in clinical neurophysiology and neurology at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. She also works for a specialist unit based at the Epilepsy Society. Alongside her work with those suffering from physical diseases, she has developed expertise in working with patients with psychogenic disorders.</p>
<p>It’s All in Your Head rose to the top of an exception shortlist, comprising five other works of fiction and non-fiction: 'The Outrun' by Amy Liptrot (Canongate); 'Signs for Lost Children' by Sarah Moss (Granta); 'Playthings' by Alex Pheby (Galley Beggar Press); 'The Last Act of Love' by Cathy Rentzenbrink (Picador); 'Neurotribes' by Steve Silberman (Allen & Unwin). As a group, the titles represent a collective conversation on medicine in literature today, demonstrating the wealth of human experience this cultural sector explores.</p>
<p>Last year’s prize was awarded to Marion Coutts for her critically lauded memoir, 'The Iceberg'. Previous winners of the Prize also include: Andrew Solomon for 'Far From the Tree: Parents, children and the search for identity' in 2014, Thomas Wright for 'Circulation' in 2012, Alice LaPlante for 'Turn of Mind' in 2011, Rebecca Skloot for 'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks' in 2010, and Andrea Gillies for 'Keeper: Living with Nancy – A Journey into Alzheimer’s' in 2009.</p>
<p>This year’s shortlisted writers have benefitted from the broad marketing, retail and events platform the Wellcome Book Prize offers, including a promotion with The Reading Agency reaching over 300 libraries UK-wide; marketing support across Foyles, Blackwells and over 300 independent bookshops across the country via Gardners and the Booksellers Association; plus spotlight events in the run up to the winner announcement and beyond at Wellcome Collection, 5x15 Stories, and Hay Festival.</p>

"3385","/press/bedlam-asylum-and-beyond-upcoming-exhibition-wellcome-collection","'Bedlam: the asylum and beyond' upcoming exhibition at Wellcome Collection","<p>
	Bedlam has long been a byword for chaos. Now a major exhibition at Wellcome Collection will open the doors to the historic asylum from which it derives. Through the lens of the Bethlem Royal Hospital, London, ‘<a href=""/bedlam"">Bedlam: the asylum and beyond</a>’ will explore how the experience of mental illness and notions of madness have been shaped over centuries, and imagine what the future might hold.</p>
<p>‘Bedlam’ will trace the rise and fall of the asylum and how it has reflected the changing attitudes of the society around it, from the early days of the Bethlem Hospital to the modern, post-asylum world in which prescription medications coexist with an increasing array of other therapies and support options. Visitors will encounter scenes from successive incarnations of Bethlem, as well as other models of care from elsewhere in the UK and Europe, revealing how each was founded in an optimistic spirit of humanitarian reform, but abandoned as therapies failed and ideas changed.</p>
<p>Emphasising the lived experiences of individuals, the exhibition will feature over 150 objects and archival materials, including patient art from Adolf Wölfli, Vaslav Nijinsky and Richard Dadd, alongside works by contemporary artists, including Eva Kot’átková, Shana Moulton, Javier Tellez and the ‘Madlove: A Designer Asylum’ project. A new digital commission for the exhibition by Erica Scourti, <em>Empathy Deck</em>, will use an online mood monitor to generate unique tarot cards, each one offering a healing approach, remedy or thought.</p>
<p>Guest curator, author and historian, Mike Jay says: “Preserved in popular imagination as ‘Bedlam’, the Bethlem Royal Hospital is perhaps the oldest institution of its kind in the world, and has witnessed the entire history of mental illness and psychiatry. Its story is the perfect focus for Wellcome Collection to explore how medicine, art and culture define mental illness, and the big questions it raises about the individual and society.”</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection co-curator Bárbara Rodríguez Muñoz adds: “The perspectives of patients and those with lived experiences of mental distress, as well as those who are blurring the boundaries between art and therapeutic practice, are at the core of this exhibition. At a time when the marketplace of treatment and support options is so broad, but often inaccessible, the exhibition both interrogates and reclaims the idea of the asylum as a place of sanctuary and care.”</p>
<p>‘Bedlam’ will open with a large-scale installation, <em>Asylum</em>, by artist Eva Kot’átková. This 2014 work was inspired by conversations with psychiatric patients and features live performers, evoking the tensions between protection and restraint that thread throughout the exhibition. Visitors will also be introduced to the alternative model of care offered by the town of Geel, Belgium, the home of patron saint of mental affliction St Dymphna, where sufferers in the middle ages were taken in by local families and became ‘boarders’, part of the community, a tradition that continues to this day.</p>
<p>The first scene from Bedlam shows Bethlem hospital’s eighteenth century site in Moorfields, as depicted in William Hogarth’s <em>The Rake’s Progress</em> (1763). This section will trace how madness was first defined by the law, and reveals how the asylum was open to public visitors, inspiring numerous plays, ballads, poems and artworks. It also features architectural plans for a new Bethlem building by one of the inmates, James Tilly Matthews: the first psychiatric hospital designs by a patient.</p>
<p>Bethlem moved in the 1800s to the building in St George’s Fields, Southwark that now houses the Imperial War Museum. Patient experiences from this era were recorded in poetry, such as <em>Epitaph, of My Poor Jack, Squirrel II</em>, by James Hadfield, and in a quarterly magazine, <em>Under the Dome</em>. The debates around physical restraint from this time are illuminated by Jane Fradgley’s haunting photographs of the quilted garments worn by patients, and definitions of normality are subverted in Javier Tellez’s film installation <em>Caligari and the Sleepwalker</em> (2008), based on the 1920 silent movie, the <em>Cabinet of Dr. Caligari </em>(which is currently featured in another Wellcome Collection exhibition: ‘States of Mind: Tracing the Edges of Consciousness’). Photographs by Henry Hering show Bethlem inmates before and after their time in the asylum, as well as the artist Richard Dadd working in his cell while confined as an ‘incurable lunatic’. Dadd turns the patient’s gaze on the doctors with his oil portrait of Bethlem’s governor Alexander Morison (1852).</p>
<p>By the twentieth century, the modern mental hospital had replaced the asylum and redefined mental illness. In 1930 Bethlem moved again to a new site, a villa complex outside the city, and began to incorporate talking and community-based therapies. At this time, patient art was considered both as therapy and a tool for analysis, with several examples shown in this section including <em>Mental Asylum Band-Copse</em> (1910) by Adolf Wölfli, one of the earliest outsider artists. <em>Abandoned Goods</em>, an essay film by Pia Borg and Edward Lawrenson tells the story of over 5500 pieces of patient artwork, now collectively known as the Adamson Collection.</p>
<p>Psychiatry changed rapidly in the twentieth century. The advent of medication as well as other treatment options, and anti-institutional movements such as the democratic psychiatry movement led by Italian Franco Basaglia, coupled with economic pressures, led to residential hospitals being decommissioned.&nbsp; The incongruities of this process are captured in humorous illustrations by Ugo Guarino (1979) alongside a brochure for luxury flats in the former Friern Barnet asylum of north London.</p>
<p>The last section of the exhibition will explore the ever-expanding marketplace of treatments and therapies in the post-asylum world, from pharmaceuticals to traditional healing and spirituality, to online support, and artistic therapies. <em>Restless Leg Saga</em> (2012), a film installation by Shana Moulton, depicts a character searching through television and magazine adverts to find relief from her condition, and is shown alongside several examples of pamphlets promoting cross cultural and holistic treatment-guides from the Wellcome Library’s collection. There will be a return to Bethlem and Geel in their current incarnations, with a selection of drawings by David Beales, an artist represented by the Bethlem Gallery, that show moments from his time inside psychiatric hospitals, and a collection of photographs by Hugo Minnen that depict boarders going about their daily lives in Geel.</p>
<p>The final work in the exhibition will be a special commission of The Vacuum Cleaner and Hannah Hull's <em>Madlove: A Designer Asylum</em>, a collaborative project with&nbsp;designers Benjamin Koslowski and James Christian, illustrator Rosie Cunningham, and over 300 people with lived experience of mental distress who are revisiting and reimagining the asylum as ‘a safe place to go mad’.</p>
<p>‘Bedlam: the asylum and beyond’ will run at Wellcome Collection from 15 September 2016 to 15 January 2017. A parallel exhibition curated by Sam Curtis, ‘Reclaiming Asylum’, will be held at the Bethlem Gallery, from 21 September– 11 November 2016.</p>
<p>The institution at the centre of this exhibition; Bethlem Royal Hospital, remains a functioning hospital based in Beckenham and is now part of South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. On the 270 acre site, sits the Bethlem Gallery and Museum, free and open to all. <em>This Way Madness Lies: The asylum and beyond</em>, a book by Mike Jay produced to accompany the exhibition, will be published by Thames & Hudson.</p>

"3255","/press/wellcome-book-prize-2016-shortlist-revealed","WELLCOME BOOK PRIZE 2016 SHORTLIST REVEALED","<p>The shortlist for the <a href=""http://wellcomebookprize.org/"">Wellcome Book Prize 2016</a> was announced today by this year’s chair of judges, the acclaimed author, journalist and broadcaster Baroness Joan Bakewell DBE. Joined by James Peto, Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection, Bakewell revealed the six shortlisted titles at a breakfast event held in Wellcome Collection’s Reading Room.</p>
<p>Celebrating the best new books that engage with any aspect of medicine, health or illness, the 2016 shortlist showcases the breadth and depth of our encounters with medicine through six exceptional works of fiction and non-fiction:</p>
<ul><li><strong>The Outrun</strong> by Amy Liptrot (Canongate)</li>
<li><strong>Signs for Lost Children</strong> by Sarah Moss (Granta)</li>
<li><strong>It’s All in Your Head</strong> by Suzanne O’Sullivan (Chatto & Windus)</li>
<li><strong>Playthings</strong> by Alex Pheby (Galley Beggar Press)</li>
<li><strong>The Last Act of Love</strong> by Cathy Rentzenbrink (Picador)</li>
<li><strong>Neurotribes</strong> by Steve Silberman (Allen & Unwin)</li>
</ul><p>From memoirs on addiction (The Outrun) and on the aftermath of a debilitating accident (The Last Act of Love) to studies on autism (Neurotribes) and psychosomatic illnesses (It’s All in Your Head), the non-fiction contenders reflect a broader preoccupation with the human mind, while the two works of fiction on the list offer an immersive account of schizophrenia (Playthings) and an account of the pioneering work of an early female medic (Signs for Lost Children). As a group, the titles represent a collective conversation on medicine in literature today, demonstrating the wealth of human experience this cultural sector explores.</p>
<p>Worth £30,000, the 2016 prize is judged by a panel comprising chair Joan Bakewell; Frances Balkwill OBE, Professor of Cancer Biology at Barts Cancer Institute and an author of science books for children; writer, columnist and salonnière Damian Barr; award-winning novelist Tessa Hadley; and award-winning journalist and author Sathnam Sanghera.</p>
<p><strong>Joan Bakewell, Chair of Judges of the Wellcome Book Prize 2016, said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“All the judges were engrossed by the range of books we had to consider: we each learned important things from the imaginative and inspiring way writers have addressed their subjects. It has been an exhilarating journey. The shortlist reflects what has moved and inspired us most about books that deal with intimate and often complex matters of the human body and human experience. Each one has found its way not just onto the shortlist, but into our hearts.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>James Peto, Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection, said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“It is wonderful to see our judges’ shortlist for the Wellcome Book Prize 2016. It proves again, I think, that Wellcome Collection’s concern with health and medicine, and more generally with the human condition, corresponds with an affecting, provocative and inspiring area of contemporary literature. I’m delighted that the shortlist encompasses both fact and fiction and offers such moving insights into both body and mind and the ways in which our health shapes our lives. There is a lot of excitement here in anticipation of the announcement in April of who the overall winner will be.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Comments from the rest of this year’s judges:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s been a huge privilege and education to judge the 2016 prize. The shortlisted books have inspired, fascinated, entertained and moved me to tears – often in equal measure.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>– Professor Frances Balkwill </em></p>
<blockquote><p>“Judging this prize has changed my reading life – I remembered that I wanted to be a doctor before I wanted to be a writer. It offers uniquely interdisciplinary delights – we see a scientist analysing a condition, then a character in a novel living with it. The shortlist could easily have been longer, but I encourage people to read all six books and experience that thrill of cross-genre thinking.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>– Damian Barr </em></p>
<blockquote><p>“What’s been so interesting, reading for the prize, is how many different ways there are of knowing about sickness and health, describing and exploring them: the subject has such powerful meaning, in memoir and in fiction, in medical speculation and in history.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>– Tessa Hadley </em></p>
<blockquote><p>“I wish I could judge the Wellcome Book Prize every year: I’ve read a whole range of books I wouldn’t normally have delved into, learned a huge deal in the process, and I think we have ended up with a really fantastic shortlist. Deciding on a winner is going to be tough.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>– Sathnam Sanghera</em></p>
<p>Last year’s prize was awarded to Marion Coutts for her critically lauded memoir, <em>The Iceberg</em>.

"3107","/press/voice-0","THIS IS A VOICE: Wellcome Collection's major spring exhibition","<p>The voice is shapeless and immaterial, and yet fills up an entire gallery in Wellcome Collection’s major spring exhibition. '<a href=""/thisisavoice"">THIS IS A VOICE</a>' looks inside vocal tracts, restless minds and speech devices to capture the elusive nature of the human voice, from its origins within the body, to the sounds ringing in our heads. Celebrating the aural and the oral, ‘THIS IS A VOICE’ features daily ‘voicings’, live performances and demonstrations, creating an acoustic journey of sound and film by contemporary artists and composers, punctuated by paintings, manuscripts, medical illustrations and ethnographic objects.</p>
<p>Artists and vocalists include Joan La Barbara, Imogen Stidworthy, Sam Belinfante, Enrico David, Meredith Monk, Marcus Coates, Anna Barham and Emma Smith, and visitors can add their own voices to the mix of sound in the gallery as part of a new work by electronic musician Mathew Herbert (Plat du Jour, The End Of Silence). Commissioned in collaboration with the Royal Opera House, Herbert’s Chorus asks visitors to sing a single note to add to a chorus of voices, forming an ever-expanding sound installation that plays in the exhibition and on the Wellcome Collection website.</p>
<p>Curator Bárbara Rodríguez Muñoz said: “The voice is one of our key identifying features; most of us use it daily and spontaneously, however its nature is far more abstract, uncanny even. It originates within us, both bodily and inside our minds, but voices can also seemingly come from nowhere, making it a deeply absorbing topic for vocalists, anthropologists, artists, scientists and philosophers alike. Focusing on non-linguistic and experimental uses of the voice, this highly performative exhibition is a quest to give form to this ambiguous creature and reveal the emotions that resonate within it.”</p>
<p>Visitors enter the exhibition through an anechoic chamber, a non-echoing corridor designed to absorb all sounds. Providing a moment of stillness, the chamber is an opportunity to shift attention from the visual to the aural before visitors are enveloped in the cacophony of the gallery.</p>
<p>In the first of five sections of the exhibition, <strong>‘Voice is the original instrument’</strong> looks at the origins of the human voice, and how singing and non-verbal sound creates both bonds and boundaries, forging group alliances and warding off enemies. The relationship between animal and human communication is brought alive with Dawn Chorus by Marcus Coates (2007). This multi-screen film installation features singers in everyday locations impersonating birdsong and explores their similarities when it comes to using rhythm, tempo and melody. This section also includes a model of the larynx, soundscapes that reveal a rich history of ritual and ceremonial polyphonic singing, an ethnographic collection of lullabies and a recording of Joan la Barbara’s Circular Song, which plays alongside a drawing of her musical score.</p>
<p>The second section of the exhibition examines the <strong>‘melodic contours’</strong> of the voice. While studies of the voice have typically been viewed through the lens of linguistics, this section focusses on the realm of the voice beyond words. Exploring prosody – pitch, tone and tempo, Emma Smith’s 5HZ (2015) is a collaborative art project that imagines what humanity might sound like if we had evolved to prioritise connection over the need to deliver explicit information. Meredith Monk, a pioneer of extended vocal technique, similarly conveys the emotive impact of communication in Dolmen Music (1980), an album in which performers create a story through singing, without uttering intelligible words. This section incorporates laughter, screaming and how prosody and emotions are performed in the absence of the voice altogether. Mikhail Karikis’ Sculpting Voice (2009) shows the facial expressions of an artist as he struggles to produce sound, and in Danica Dakić’s Emily (2010) we see a girl learning sign language, but we hear the dominating voice of her teacher.</p>
<p><strong>‘The strains of the voice’</strong> investigates the mechanics and physiology of voice production and how the voice can be changed following disorder, trauma or training. In Focus (2012) by Sam Belinfante, vocalist Elaine Mitchener is shown exercising her voice before a performance revealing the ways that different physical techniques dramatically affect her sound. Imogen Stidworthy’s Castrato layers three vocal types, treble, female soprano and counter tenor, to engineer the sound of a castrato voice: a human sound that can no longer exist, further emphasising the connections between our voices and our bodies. These are displayed alongside diagrams that illustrate the workings of the vocal tract, including footage of vocal cord vibrations, a preserved human larynx and contrasting MRI scans depicting vocalisations in action.</p>
<p>Identification and perception is explored in <strong>‘Egophony’</strong>, investigating the ways in which the voice, like a fingerprint, can locate and expose us, socially and psychologically as well as geographically. Clues to gender and status may be revealed by features of our voices like pitch, volume and accent, but the stereotypes and politics associated with vocal identity are complex, and are made more so by the fact that voices evolve and can be changed. This section features Katarina Zdjedlar’s film The Perfect Sound (2009), which shows a migrant taking an accent removal class with a speech therapist in Birmingham, a city which is paradoxically known for its strong accent, and a film by Chris Chapman that looks at the process of re-training the voice following gender transition. A further display, co-curated with artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan, forms a timeline of voice analysis technology and its role in capturing and shaping the truth.</p>
<p>From mythological sirens and the singing severed head of Orpheus; through divine revelations, inner speech and voice hearing; to telephones, robotics and talking machines, disembodied voices are a considered in <strong>‘The unlocated voice’</strong>. Exploring what happens when the source of voice production is hidden or not there at all, this section features the manuscripts of mediaeval Christian mystic, Julian of Norwich, which capture her experience of hearing the Voice of God and are thought to be the first works published in the English language by a woman. This section also includes a film of Samuel Beckett’s short, monologue ‘Not I’ (1972), relentlessly delivered by a disembodied mouth, as well as a look at a new form of psychological treatment for auditory hallucinations, speech disorders, and historic attempts to humanise prosthetic, robotic voices.</p>
<p>James Peto, Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection, adds: “Before and beyond words, our voices say so much about us – and yet we think very little about how, and why, we make the noises that come out of our mouths. This exhibition is full of haunting, strange and beautiful sounds, encouraging unusual and exciting ways of thinking about both the physiology and the psychology of the human voice.”</p>
<p>'<a href=""/thisisavoice"">THIS IS A VOICE</a>' runs from 14 April to 31 July 2016 at Wellcome Collection and will be touring to the Powerhouse, Sydney in 2017.</p>

	Wellcome Collection opens the second part of a year-long exploration into human consciousness on 4 February 2016. ‘<a href=""/exhibitions/states-mind-tracing-edges-consciousness"">States of Mind: Tracing the Edges of Consciousness</a>’ examines the universal, yet mysterious, topic of conscious experience. This major exhibition brings together artists, psychologists, philosophers and neuroscientists to investigate the terrain between consciousness and unconsciousness and will feature historical material, objects, artworks and an evolving programme of contemporary art installations.</p>
<p>Following on from Ann Veronica Janssens’ disorientating mist installation ‘<a href=""/exhibitions/states-mind-ann-veronica-janssens"">yellowbluepink</a>’ which probed the nature of individual perception, ‘States of Mind’ further questions the reliability of our inner world and subjective experience. The show explores phenomena such as synaesthesia, sleepwalking, memory loss and anaesthesia, and examines what happens when our conscious experience is undermined through dysfunctional experiences of perception or through loss of consciousness.</p>
<p>Curator Emily Sargent says: “Consciousness is a fascinating subject, as magical as it is everyday. We all know what it is like to be conscious, but it remains a challenge to truly define it. This makes it rich territory both for artists and scientists alike. This exhibition examines a range of different experiences from the edges of consciousness revealing both the wonder and fragility of our internal lives. It looks at ways in which philosophy, art and folklore have established frameworks of understanding for phenomena like the nightmarish hallucinations of sleep paralysis; explores language and memory as ways of defining the self and discovers how neuroscience is pushing back the very definitions of what we understand consciousness to be in the study of patients previously thought beyond awareness. It also provides the opportunity to bring together a wonderful collection of objects, artworks and films to explore this broad, eclectic subject - at once both unique and universal.”</p>
<p>The first of four sections, ‘SCIENCE | SOUL’, takes as its starting point key moments in the historical emergence of the field of neuroscience. The pervasive idea of ‘dualism’, the separation of mind and body first formally outlined by Rene Descartes in the seventeenth century, is illustrated by works such as ‘The Soul hovering over the Body reluctantly parting with Life’ by Luigi Schiavonetti, after William Blake. Philosophers and scientists have long tried to define how these two worlds interact and explain how an objective brain can produce the subjective experience of consciousness. The papers of Francis Crick show that he worked on this ‘hard problem’ until the day he died in 2004, and his notes are displayed alongside neuron drawings by Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the founder of neuroscience. This section also explores synaesthesia, a condition where one sensation may trigger another, for example author Vladimir Nabokov’s experience of seeing letters as colours is illustrated by Alphabet in Colour.</p>
<p>The spaces between sleep and wakefulness, as well as phenomena such as somnambulism, mesmerism and sleep paralysis, are explored in ‘SLEEP | AWAKE’. This section includes archive material from the first trial where ‘insanity of sleep’ was successfully used as a defence, as well as footage from The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, a 1920 film about a man who is controlled while asleep. The experience of sleep paralysis, where sleepers are mentally awake but the body remains unable to move, is reflected in a preparatory drawing for Henry Fuseli’s 1781 painting, The Nightmare, a work that has formed the basis for many other depictions of this phenomenon, and Carla Mackinnon’s immersive installation Squeezed by the shadows.</p>
<p>The development of language in childhood is closely linked to the recognition of a sense of self. In ‘LANGUAGE | MEMORY’, artist Louise K Wilson invites visitors to participate in her research into autobiographical memory, pieces from A. R. Hopwood’s False Memory Archive question the reliability of recollections and Mary Kelly’s Post-Partum Document is a series of drawings charting her changing relationship with her son as he begins to develop speech.</p>
<p>‘BEING | NOT BEING’ further explores what happens when consciousness is disordered, following injury or trauma. fMRI scans of patients in persistent vegetative, or minimally conscious, states have been shown to reveal imaginative activity, and this section explores the implications and ethical debates surrounding the care, rehabilitation and end-of-life wishes of these individuals. This section also looks at anaesthesia, a state of reversible coma and the closest we get to brain stem death, with another work by Aya Ben Ron, Still Under Treatment (2005), showing the moments in which patients fall unconscious under general anaesthetic.</p>
<p>A project space is built into the gallery to house a changing programme of installations throughout the show, linked to language and memory. In the first of these, The Whisper Heard, artist Imogen Stidworthy contrasts the language acquisition of a young child with that of a stroke patient with aphasia, using their responses to a passage from ‘Journey to the Centre of the Earth’ to explore concepts of language, meaning and identity. H.M.’, is a film by Kerry Tribe previously shown at MOMA, which uses two synchronised projectors to play two parts of a film with a 20 second delay between them to reflect the experience of Henry Gustav Molaison, better known as ‘Patient H.M’, whose case radically advanced our understanding of memory. Finally, Shona Illingworth explores the impact of amnesia and the erasure of individual and cultural memory with work from her Lesions in the Landscape project which examines personal experience of memory loss in one woman alongside the sudden evacuation of the island of St Kilda in the 1930s.</p>
<p>James Peto, Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection, adds: “Rather than seeking to define the slippery subject of consciousness, ‘States of Mind’ looks at the intriguing areas around its edges: those moments or states of being between wakefulness and sleep, feeling and anaesthesia, awareness and oblivion. The exhibition will run for a whole year, so that a changing programme of installations and exhibits can encourage reflection on the different perspectives scientists, philosophers and artists have brought to the difficult question of what it means to be ‘conscious’; how does each of us perceive and relate to our surroundings and to ourselves?”</p>

"2983","/press/james-peto-appointed-head-public-programmes-wellcome-collection","James Peto appointed Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection","<p>James Peto has been appointed Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection. Peto has been at the museum since it opened in 2007, co-curating, amongst others, its first temporary exhibition, The Heart and, as Chief Curator, managing a team that has delivered critically acclaimed and increasingly popular shows exploring the connections between life, art and medicine.</p>
<p>Peto takes over from Ken Arnold, who will become Creative Director at the Wellcome Trust, the global health foundation which runs Wellcome Collection, focussing on developing international opportunities for cultural collaboration and exchange. From summer 2016 Arnold will also run the Medical Museion in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Peto will lead the exhibition, events and publications teams at Wellcome Collection and starts his new role after a major expansion of the venue. A £17.5million development was completed in February this year to meet extraordinary demand. Built to cater for 100,000 Wellcome Collection has attracted over half a million yearly visits, and audiences continue to grow. Despite and because of this public appetite, the museum will continue to prioritise depth of engagement over numbers, and Peto will look to extend its innovative and experimental approach to programming and seeking to collaborate and commission creatively.</p>
<p>Peto studied Languages and Art History at Cambridge University and later joined the Independent Study Programme at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. He has previously worked on exhibitions for the ICA, Nottingham Castle Museum, Tyne and Wear Museums and the Whitechapel Art Gallery, and was Head of Exhibitions at the Design Museum before joining the Wellcome Trust.</p>
<p>James Peto says “With expanded exhibition and event spaces to programme and some great book titles brewing, this is a really exciting time for Wellcome Collection. The team here is alive with programming ideas. I am really looking forward to working with them to extend the range of our partners and the reach of Wellcome Collection’s activities in order to bring these ideas to a wider audience.”</p>
<p>Simon Chaplin, Director of Culture and Society at the Wellcome Trust, says “James has been a key factor in the enormous critical and popular success of Wellcome Collection’s exhibitions since we opened in 2007. His vision and imagination and the talent he has developed in our wider exhibitions team make him the perfect candidate to lead the next stage of Wellcome Collection’s creative journey.”</p>
<p>Peto’s previous role, Head of Exhibitions, will be filled by Kate Forde. Previously Senior Curator, Forde has been at Wellcome Collection for nine years, leading the curation of highly successful exhibitions such as ‘Dirt’ and ‘The Institute of Sexology’. Prior to Wellcome Collection, Forde worked at The Arts Council, The Metropolitan Museum of Art and Tate.</p>
<p>Peto adds: “Kate Forde has been involved in Wellcome Collection since it opened and has been instrumental in delivering exhibitions that inspire, intrigue and challenge our visitors. I am delighted that she is to take over as Head of Exhibitions, both personally and on behalf of the outstanding team here.”</p>

<p>The archive of NCT (National Childbirth Trust) documenting 60 years of the organisation’s history, has been catalogued by the Wellcome Library and is available to access for research from today.</p>
<p>The archive covers the activities of NCT from its formation in 1956 to the present day, providing a unique insight into maternity care and childbirth through the second half of the twentieth century. It is a valuable record of the organisation’s development, from grassroots beginnings in village halls and living rooms to becoming a household name. It encompasses both NCT’s internal documents, including correspondence and minutes, and external publications, such as campaign material, policy papers, audio visual materials and teaching resources. Correspondence from women sharing accounts of their own experiences and photographs of antenatal classes give personal and informative snapshots of pregnancy and childbirth over a period when attitudes and practice around both altered dramatically.</p>
<p>NCT, which will celebrate its 60th anniversary in 2016, was originally called the Natural Childbirth Association and was established for the promotion and better understanding of natural childbirth as described and advocated by the British obstetrician Grantly Dick-Read. Its work opposed the over-medicalisation of childbirth and the charity was famous for high profile campaigns promoting breastfeeding, supporting home births and against the overuse of interventions such as caesarean sections, all of which are documented in the archive. Today NCT is the UK’s largest parent charity supporting all parents through the First 1000 Days of pregnancy and parenthood and continues to campaign on issues including perinatal mental health, maternity pay and the cost of childcare.</p>
<p>Highlights from the archive include:</p>
<ul><li>Labour and birth reports from mothers, 1959-1991</li>
<li>Surveys and reports documenting women’s experiences and attitudes towards childbirth, choice in childbirth, induction and postnatal care</li>
<li>Policy research papers documenting NCT’s campaigning and lobbying work, including papers documenting NCT’s interactions with Government and key campaigns (including breastfeeding promotion, home birth and birth environment and maternity services)</li>
<li>Audio visual materials, including footage of NCT antenatal classes and women discussing their birth experiences</li>
<li>Teaching and education material, including antenatal class notebooks, teaching resources, and correspondence about natural childbirth techniques</li>
<li>NCT publications, including early newsletters, information sheets, booklets and leaflets, and books</li>
</ul><p>The archive was deposited at the Wellcome Library in 2014 and consists of over 270 boxes of material that have taken a year to catalogue. It complements other collections held at the Library, including the archives of Grantly Dick-Read and the National Birthday Trust Fund, creating a rich resource for exploring the range of views, and often impassioned debates, surrounding childbirth in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Elena Carter, Project Archivist at the Wellcome Library, said: “NCT’s archive not only tells the story of the institutional history of the charity, but also reflects how the experiences and expectations of parents, as well as the attitudes of doctors towards expectant mothers, have changed over the past 60 years. The collection explores how women responded to their experiences of childbirth through organisation and advocacy, highlighting the development of post-war women’s activism and women’s rights, the growth of the consumer voice, and notions of choice and control in maternity care.</p>
<p>We are delighted that these papers are now open and accessible for research, and excited about the research potential this will offer to a range of historians interested in women’s history and the social history of maternity and childbirth.”</p>
<p>Nick Wilkie, Chief Executive of NCT, said: “This collection brings to life the history of NCT and of childbirth in the UK and we’re delighted to be able to share it in this way. It shows how our organisation has grown and evolved over the years, becoming the UK’s largest charity for parents. For more than half a century we have worked to ensure all parents-to-be and new parents feel supported, informed and confident. We have done this through pioneering thought leadership, achieving important legislative and policy changes and continually listening to parents. As our 60th anniversary approaches we are continuing to develop as an organisation, always trying to improve the support we offer all mums and dads and campaigning on issues that matter most to parents.”</p>
<p>Members of the Wellcome Library can request access to the archive for research from 28 September 2015. A small number of images and two films produced by NCT are available online and the NCT catalogue can be searched on the Wellcome Library catalogue using the reference SA/NCT. Some sections of the archive are subject to closure or restriction periods to protect the identities of women and children whose experiences are recorded.</p>

<p><strong>19 November 2015 – 28 February 2016 </strong></p>
<p>Wellcome Collection’s major winter exhibition, ‘Tibet’s Secret Temple’, uncovers the mysteries of Tantric Buddhism and the rich history of its yogic and meditation practices. Taking inspiration from a series of intricate murals that adorn the walls of the Lukhang Temple in Lhasa, Tibet, the exhibition showcases over 120 outstanding objects from collections around the world that illuminate the secrets of the temple, once used exclusively by Tibet’s Dalai Lamas.</p>
<p>Originally accessible only by boat, the Lukhang, or ‘Temple to the Serpent Spirits’, was built in the late 17th century, during the reigns of the fifth and sixth Dalai Lamas, as a private sanctuary for meditation and spiritual practice, secreted behind the Potala Palace. The murals in the uppermost chamber of the temple helped guide the Dalai Lamas on their journey to enlightenment and have been recreated by photographer Thomas Laird as spectacular life-sized digital artworks that form the centrepiece of the exhibition. This is the first time whole Tibetan wall murals have ever been displayed in a museum as transparencies.</p>
<p>‘Tibet’s Secret Temple’ progresses through 12 themed rooms in the main gallery space at Wellcome Collection. Each room explores a different aspect of the Lukhang, its history and origins as well as Tibetan Buddhist beliefs and practices with relevance to modern understandings of meditation, mindfulness and wellbeing. The exhibition begins with a contemporary film installation by film maker David Bickerstaff, and includes original artefacts from public and private collections, including Tantric yogic implements and exquisite statues of yogis and Buddhist deities such as the naga, or lu –the serpent spirits to whom the Lukhang Temple is dedicated. Photographs and models of the temple itself show its construction as a three-dimensional maṇḍala, a sacred geometrical shape that represents the Buddhist universe, with its three tiers representing three dimensions of enlightenment – outer reality, inner experience, and a transcendent dimension beyond time and space.</p>
<p>A series of scroll paintings, or thangkas, depict the traditional Tibetan medical system and its representations of subtle physiological processes essential to optimal health. Outlining energy channels and their points of convergence (or chakras) within the body, these artworks are displayed alongside early Tibetan ritual diagrams as well as details from Laird’s images of the Lukhang murals, to illustrate Tantric Buddhism’s emphasis on wholeness and harmony between the body and mind. Other sections of the exhibition portray the human form in dynamic movement, such as in sacred Cham dances and Tibetan forms of physical yoga, that reflect Tantric Buddhism’s understanding of the flow of internal energies within the human body and their connection with heightened mental states.</p>
<p>Ornaments made from human bone, bowls carved from skulls, ritual implements for cutting away the ego as well as masks and statues of fierce Tibetan deities, evoke darker aspects of existence that Tantric Buddhism embraces in its journey to wholeness. Primarily used in ceremonial rites, these objects evoke awareness of life’s fundamental impermanence. They highlight the transcendence of fear and inhibition and expanded forms of consciousness that Tibetan Buddhists cultivate through the yogic and meditational practices illustrated in the Lukhang murals.</p>
<p>To foster greater understanding of their potential benefits to health and wellbeing, His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama has increasingly encouraged the scientific study of even the most closely-guarded techniques illustrated in the Lukhang murals, which were once only taught to highly advanced practitioners. The final room of the exhibition explores scientific investigations into these once secret practices of Tantric Buddhism and their impact on psychological and physiological health and understandings of human consciousness.</p>
<p>Ruth Garde, curator of the exhibition said: “While Tantric Buddhism has invited many myths and interpretations, ‘Tibet’s Secret Temple’ takes visitors through its long and rich history. The extraordinarily beautiful objects in this exhibition come together to reveal stories that were hidden from all but the most advanced practitioners of Tantric Buddhism, and provide a rare opportunity to engage with aspects of Tibet and its spiritual practices that I hope will surprise and intrigue visitors.”</p>
<p>Ian Baker, a Tibetan Buddhist scholar who served as the exhibition’s external curator, said: “This exhibition represents the first time that objects connected to secret Tantric Buddhist practices have been displayed openly to the public. The exhibition highlights the relevance of these practices in today’s global society and their ongoing contribution to a deeper understanding of the possibilities and potential of human existence.”</p>
<p>Tibet’s Secret Temple: Body, Mind and Meditation in Tantric Buddhism runs at Wellcome Collection, 183 Euston Road, from 19 November 2015 to 28 February 2016. A full programme of events will accompany Tibet’s Secret Temple and there will be a postcard book available, featuring some of Laird’s Lukhang mural details, as well as other selected works from the exhibition.</p>

<li>Part of Why Music? weekend of events and broadcasts from BBC Radio 3 and Wellcome Collection</li>
</ul><p>Today, BBC Radio 3 and Wellcome Collection announce a world premiere live broadcast of Max Richter’s ground-breaking and experimental new composition SLEEP, to be performed live from Wellcome Collection into the early hours of the morning as part of the Why Music? weekend.</p>
<p>Composed in consultation with renowned American neuroscientist David Eagleman, the “lullaby for a frenetic world” is meant to be heard whilst sleeping. Audiences across the UK are invited to hear the broadcast as they sleep whilst the composer experiments to find out what effect hearing music has on our subconscious mind.</p>
<p>Max Richter said: “The BBC Radio 3 “Why Music?” broadcasts from Wellcome Collection neatly sum up what my piece is about. I think of SLEEP as an experiment into how music and the mind can interact in this other state of consciousness, one we all spend decades of our lives completely immersed in, but which is so far rather poorly understood. I consulted with the neuroscientist David Eagleman on how music can relate to the sleep state and have incorporated our conversations in the compositional process of the work.”</p>
<p>Thought to be one of the longest pieces of music ever recorded, SLEEP will be the longest single continuous piece of music ever broadcast live on the BBC. Richter will perform the piece with an ensemble of leading players and a soprano in the Reading Room at Wellcome Collection in a piece lasting eight hours, starting at midnight and ending at 8am. The performance will be broadcast continuously live on BBC Radio 3 and will be attended by a small audience who will sleep over in the Reading Room, amongst bookshelves and artefacts. The broadcast will then be available to catch-up on BBC Radio iPlayer for 30 days.</p>
<p>SLEEP is broadcast as part of Why Music?, a free weekend of public events and one-off broadcasts from BBC Radio 3 in partnership with Wellcome Collection. The three day programme will include lectures and debates from neuroscientists, psychologists and psychiatrists, with performances from artists and musicians to explore the relationship between music and the mind, mental health, evolution, nature and behaviour.</p>
<p>Alan Davey, Controller, Radio 3 said: “I am excited that Radio 3 has the opportunity to present a world broadcast premiere that will bring an added dimension to the night for sleeping listeners everywhere. The impact of music on the human mind is a subject for debate and investigation, and is the key question at the heart of Radio 3’s broadcast weekend from Wellcome Collection. The broadcast of eight hours of new music from one of the UK’s most exciting contemporary composers is sure to be a highlight of this significant event.""</p>
<p>Rosie Stanbury, Events Manager at Wellcome Collection said: ""We’re thrilled to be hosting the first performance of Max Richter’s new composition and to be working with BBC Radio 3, whose live broadcast will take SLEEP to a slumbering audience across the UK. It is a brilliant addition to the Why Music? weekend, which will include a variety performances and events that explore, probe and challenge the nature of our human relationship with music. Inviting people to snuggle down to sleep through the night in the Reading Room will definitely be a first for us, but it seems a fittingly experimental event to take place in our most experimental space.”</p>
<p>In the week leading up to the performance of SLEEP, Radio 3 will be running an on air competition on In Tune and Breakfast offering 4 listeners a chance to attend the unique live performance in Wellcome Collection’s Reading Room.</p>

<p><strong>15 October 2015 – 3 January 2016</strong></p>
<p>Wellcome Collection will launch a year-long exploration into the experience of human consciousness with <a href=""/exhibitions/states-mind-ann-veronica-janssens"">a new installation by Ann Veronica Janssens</a>. The artist will fill an entire gallery with an enveloping and brightly coloured mist in a work called <em>yellowbluepink</em>.</p>
<p>Janssens explores perception through the use of light and colour. In her mist installation at Wellcome Collection, colour is caught in a state of suspension, defying the apparent immateriality of the medium and veiling any detail of surface or depth within the space. As visitors walk through this thickly coloured world, attention is focussed on the process of perception itself - an experience both disorienting and uplifting, heightening the wonder of our own consciousness. Entering the gallery is to submit to colour as a physical entity and to be subsumed by the experience of seeing.</p>
<p>Ann Veronica Janssens’ installation launches States of Mind, a year-long investigation into human consciousness; a topic defined as much by what is yet to be understood as what can be readily explained. At the heart of the subject lies the ‘hard question’ of why objective brains give rise to our subjective consciousness. Neuroscience can explain the relationship between brain activity and conscious functions such as memory retention or decision making. Yet it struggles to describe how the activity of neurons results in our individual experience of colour, as in Janssens' vibrant environment.</p>
<p>Emily Sargent, curator, says “Without understanding exactly how it happens, we are all experts in our own experience. Ann Veronica Janssens’ sensory installation reminds us of the richness of our interaction with the world; a personal universe of experience constructed within the confines of our skulls. Janssens' work disorientates the viewer through the dissolution of normal perceptual boundaries. The mist appears to disintegrate the materiality of the space whilst at the same time imparting a materiality and tactility to light and colour. Visitors are participants in an experiment which challenges habitual practices of seeing and accords a fresh emphasis to the simple fact of experience.”</p>
<p>A major new exhibition will follow Janssens' installation in February 2016, exploring the edges of human consciousness and phenomena such as synaesthesia, sleepwalking, memory loss and anaesthesia. Drawing on voices from art, psychology, philosophy and neuroscience the show will question the reliability of our inner world and examine the terrain between states of consciousness and unconsciousness, sleep and wakefulness, where expectations are confounded and perception skewed. The exhibition will include an evolving programme of artist’s installations with work by Imogen Stidworthy, Kerry Tribe and Shona Illingworth.</p>
<p>Ann Veronica Janssens’ <em>yellowbluepink</em> runs from 15 October 2015 – 3 January 2016<br /><em>States of Mind: Tracing the edges of consciousness</em> runs from 4 February to 16 October 2016.</p>
<p>There will be a press view on 14 October between 8.30 and 10.30.</p>

<p>From brain scans to world classical music premieres, BBC Radio 3 will broadcast live from Wellcome Collection for the first time this September to explore the power of music with three days of live music, discussion and one-off programmes. Throughout the weekend, audiences and visitors to Wellcome Collection will be able to discover how music can manipulate our behaviour and even shape the human brain, affecting our physical and mental wellbeing, our language, literature and memory. Why Music? will be broadcast from Friday 25 September – Sunday 27 September on Radio 3 and available to catch-up for 30 days.</p>
<p>Asking the question Why Music?, leading musicians will be joined by authorities in the fields of neuroscience, music therapy and music psychology for the three-day programme of live and recorded broadcasts exploring what makes music a vital part of being human. Radio 3’s pop-up studio will appear in Wellcome Café on the ground floor of Wellcome Collection, providing a hub for live broadcasts from the venue and allowing visitors to see and share in the weekend’s programming. Broadcasts will also take place in the newly re-furbished Reading Room and the Henry Wellcome Auditorium.</p>
<p>Among the highlights, BBC Radio 3 Presenter Andrew McGregor will find out how and why the brain responds to different sorts of music by studying his own brain scan, and Tom Service will examine how music has influenced our evolutionary development; is music just “auditory cheesecake”? Concert pianist and psychiatrist Dr Richard Kogan will put composers on to the couch as he examines the influence their mental state has had on their work, and psychologist Lauren Stewart and composer and pianist Neil Brand will explore “The Tingle Factor”; what is it about music that sends a shiver down our spines?</p>
<p>Following their performance at the 2015 BBC Proms of Beethoven’s ‘Pastoral Symphony’ and the world premiere of Anna Meredith’s ‘Smatter Hauler’, also performed from memory, members of the Aurora Orchestra will perform three world premieres from three young composers on the BBC Proms Inspire scheme, and a work written specially for Why Music? by New Zealander Antonia Barnett-McIntosh, resident composer with the Hubbub interdisciplinary research group at Wellcome Collection. They will also perform composer Anna Meredith’s ‘Chorale’ for MRI scanner and string quartet.</p>
<p>Two ‘trusted guides’ will also be on hand throughout the weekend to answer questions from listeners and audiences: researcher and lecturer at Sheffield University Victoria Williamson and popular science writer Philip Ball.</p>
<p>Leading minds from the fields of neuroscience, music therapy and music psychology, including Dr Richard Kogan, Professor Marcus du Sautoy, Professor Richard Hargreaves, Mary King, Lauren Stewart and Steven Mithen, will contribute to programmes and discussion exploring music’s relationship with nature, memory, mental illness and mathematics.</p>
<p>Throughout the weekend, comedian, actor, presenter and author Griff Rhys Jones, in conversation with Simon Chaplin (Director of Culture and Society at the Wellcome Trust), presents his choice of five extraordinary objects from Wellcome Collection in five programmes recorded specially for Why Music?. Radio 3 listeners will also have the chance to hear some of the music and sounds from the Golden Record, the disc placed on board the two Voyager spacecraft on their 1977 launch to help aliens understand human beings.</p>
<p>Visitors to Wellcome Collection over the weekend will have the opportunity to record their own accounts of significant musical moments in their lives in Radio 3’s pop-up studio, with a chance to hear some played on air.</p>
<p>Alan Davey, Controller, BBC Radio 3 said: “Music has inspired me my entire life; it has the ability to physically affect us in hard to define and mysterious ways. I’m delighted BBC Radio 3 will be working with Wellcome Collection for the first time to delve into why music has such an impact on humans. As a cultural institution BBC Radio 3 aims to bring classical music and culture to as many people as possible in an expert and engaging way. By working together in partnership with organisations like Wellcome Collection, we hope to bring this fusion of science and classical music to inquiring minds everywhere this September.”</p>
<p>Rosie Stanbury, Events Manager at Wellcome Collection said: ““Why Music?” is our first live radio broadcast residency and we’re thrilled to be working with BBC Radio 3 to fill our newly transformed galleries and spaces with sound, music and debate. Wellcome Collection’s events offer rich opportunities to indulge your curiosity and explore what it means to be human and this long weekend of extraordinary performances, new commissions and live broadcasts - from Radio’s 3’s pop up studio in our café and around our building - will give visitors and listeners alike a unique experience of the complex relationship between music and the human condition.”</p>
<p>BBC Radio 3's Tom Service, Andrew McGregor, Sarah Walker and All in the Mind presenter Claudia Hammond are amongst the presenters who will be broadcasting live on BBC Radio 3 from Wellcome Collection over the weekend, along with artists including pianist James Rhodes, pianist, arranger and composer Neil Brand, experimental pianist Sarah Nicolls, vocal group The Clerks, rapper Ghostpoet, and members of the innovative Aurora Orchestra will perform three live concerts at Wellcome Collection. The BBC Concert Orchestra will also perform at Maida Vale studios broadcast live on Radio 3.</p>
<p>All tickets are free and will be available from Friday 28 August. They can be booked via Wellcome Collection’s website, apart from tickets for the BBC Concert Orchestra’s Maida Vale performance which will be available from bbc.co.uk/tickets.</p>

"2713","/press/ken-arnold-announced-creative-director-medical-museion-copenhagen","Ken Arnold announced as Creative Director of Medical Museion, Copenhagen","<p>Ken Arnold, Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection, has been announced as the new Creative Director at Medical Museion, the innovative museum and research unit at the University of Copenhagen. Ken brings over 20 years’ experience of staging critically acclaimed exhibitions and events exploring the connections between medicine, art and life to his new role and will divide his time between London and Copenhagen from Spring 2016, fostering new and collaborative dialogues between the two venues and around public engagement with science and art. </p>
<p>Medical Museion holds one of the richest historical collections of medical artefacts in Europe, containing some 250,000 objects dating back to the early 17th Century. Under the leadership of its outgoing director, Professor Thomas Söderqvist, it has developed into one of the leading museums of its kind in the world with a dynamic research and curatorial programme combining academic enquiry around the medical humanities with prize-winning exhibitions and events.</p>
<p>Ken Arnold has been associated with Medical Museion as a visiting professor since 2010, working closely with Söderqvist, who has decided to step down as director to be able to concentrate on his research as a professor in history of medicine at the University.</p>
<p>Arnold has worked at museums on both sides of the Atlantic and joined the Wellcome Trust in 1992, developing interdisciplinary cultural projects and co-ordinating its arts funding initiatives. The Trust opened Wellcome Collection in 2007 and the venue has recently completed a £17.5million expansion due to overwhelming demand for its critically acclaimed programme of exhibitions and events exploring what it means to be human.</p>
<p>Ken Arnold says: “I am honoured and delighted to be taking up the Creative Directorship of Medical Museion. Wellcome Collection and Medical Museion are both intriguingly similar and fascinatingly different public venues. Each, I believe, has much to gain from becoming more familiar with the other: two collections, two teams, two buildings and two programmes; and in finding natural ways in which inspiration and collaboration can follow. I see my unusual double-role as an ideal position from which to encourage this to happen, and I wait with excited anticipation to see how this symbiotic relationship evolves.”</p>
<p>Dean Ulla Wewer from the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, says: “I am proud of welcoming an internationally strong profile like Ken Arnold. I am greatly looking forward to working with him, and I am extremely pleased that both the University of Copenhagen and the city of Copenhagen stand to benefit from his extensive experience and visionary approaches to research and science communication.”</p>
<p>Arnold will combine the role of Creative Director of Medical Museion with a new position as Creative Director at the Wellcome Trust from Spring 2016, focussed on evolving the cultural activities of Wellcome Collection beyond London, developing international and national projects across exhibitions, tours, live events, publications, digital and broadcast platforms.</p>

The work is a series of triptych video portraits, bringing together two earlier projects involving the group with newly recorded footage. By turns funny, moving and poignant, these short pieces lay out the dramas of everyday life with keen and affecting  precision.</p>
<p>In 1994, several hundred Colchester schoolchildren aged 8-11 were invited to make a 15 second video portrait expressing themselves any way they chose. Ten years later, Dorley-Brown tracked down some of the participants and filmed them shortly after they viewed their earlier footage; in 2014 he made a third series of video portraits. Brought together as a digital online artwork, the three selves of the participants now enter into a generational dialogue with each other.</p>
<p>The first set of video portraits were made in an era before the internet became a part of everyday life; the last were made in a time where self-presentation through social media is everywhere. Across these changes in medium and forms of expression Dorley-Brown’s ’15 Seconds’ presents concise and compelling accounts of growing up, thwarted ambition and the search to find what makes you happy in life.</p>
<p>Danny Birchall, Digital Manager at Wellcome Collection says “This first major digital commission from Wellcome Collection offers us an opportunity to reach new audiences across the world with work that addresses the human condition in the same way that our new and expanded galleries do. ’15 Seconds’ is a work that has taken many different forms over 20 years, from DVD to installation: working with Chris to develop and produce a version for the internet felt like the work’s next logical step.”</p>

"2639","/press/alice-anderson-wellcome-collection-memory-movement-memory-objects","Alice Anderson at Wellcome Collection: Memory Movement Memory Objects","<p>22 July – 18 October</p>
<p>From July 2015 Wellcome Collection presents a major exhibition of works by artist Alice Anderson: ‘Memory Movement Memory Objects’. Anderson’s sculptures are entirely mummified in copper thread, creating glistening landscapes of beautiful, uncanny and transformed objects. Each piece is an exploration and act of memory. Both the making and display of works interrogate how we create, record, and transform the present and how we imagine the future. Over 100 works woven round with wire will be displayed and, uniquely, visitors will be invited to contribute to the creation of a new artwork during the run of the exhibition, as a car is mummified in the gallery.</p>
<p>‘Memory Movement Memory Objects’ will comprise five areas, the first of which, ‘the Studio’, will extend the creative process of the artist’s practice into the gallery. Visitors will be able to spend time mummifying a 1967 Ford Mustang and other smaller objects with copper wire, in a performance at once meditative and communal. The objects have significance to the artist but there is no nostalgia in their selection. The sounds of unspooling bobbins of wire and metal enclosing metal will provide a soundtrack to the space, where collaborative focus and repetitive movement elicit a reflection on consciousness and our mutable relationship to time.</p>
<p>‘Recognisable Objects’ will bring together familiar shapes, from computers, window frames, drawing books and bicycles, to larger structures, such as a staircase and a boat.&nbsp; Both taken from the artist’s studio and created by invited contributors, these works will be presented as glittering ensembles. ‘Abstract Objects’ will feature geometric forms where ornamentation is held not in the shape of objects but the shining textured patterns of the copper wire that contains them. ‘Assemblage and Accumulation’ will make unlikely and suggestive alignments, with grouped items bound and encapsulated together. ‘Distorted Objects’ will see new shapes emerge as objects are twisted and transformed by the pressure of wire wound around them, or physical definition is lost to the accretion of copper.</p>
<p>The gallery will carry the mesmerising glint of displayed treasure, akin to entering a Pharaoh’s tomb, but the objects on show are fashioned relics, or new archaeology. Strikingly lit, the sheen of copper is, for the artist, key to the absorbing physical and mental experience of entombing objects. The process of mummification is simultaneously a gesture of protection and an invocation of death, and Anderson’s exquisite sculptures pose challenging questions about the comforts and consolations of creating and sharing memories. Offering an alternative way of remembering, the exhibition will animate the terrain where movement, objects and consciousness meet.</p>
<p>Alice Anderson says: “‘Memory Movement Memory Objects’ brings together works and process in the gallery. The Studio is a place producing a solidarity bound to objects. Each woven item is a ritual object. Small ones elicit an intense concentration, generating fast motions, whilst larger objects require slower movements that engender deep collaboration and exchange. These charged works are markers of time and affirm for me the value of physical records and the power of human memory in the fascinating digital age we live in.”</p>
<p>Kate Forde, Curator, says: “With this exhibition Alice Anderson shows that even those objects that ‘speak’ to us because of their familiarity are fundamentally altered by our experience of time. Anderson’s invitation to create a social sculpture will enable visitors to discover both the unstable nature of memory and its profoundly creative potential.&nbsp; As we attempt to bridge the gap between then and now we are also called upon to connect with each other, and to move from being onlookers to participants.”</p>
<p>‘Memory Movement Memory Objects’ runs from 22 July to 18 October 2015. A publication and full programme of events will accompany the exhibition.</p>
<p>There will be a press view on 21 July between 0930 and 1230. RSVPs to <a href=""mailto:t.morley@wellcome.ac.uk"">t.morley@wellcome.ac.uk</a></p>

<h2>NOTES TO EDITORS</h2>
<p>Alice Anderson studied at Goldsmiths College in London from 2001 to 2004. Recent projects include ‘Data’, at the Espace Culturel Louis Vuitton, Paris (2015), ‘Objectified’ at the Saatchi Gallery London (2015), ‘British Contemporary Art’ at Rizzordi Art Foundation, St Petersburg (2014), ‘White Light’, 55th Venice Biennale (2013), ‘Notebooks’ at the Whitechapel Art Gallery (2012) and ‘Childhood Rituals' (2011) at the Freud Museum which was a cornerstone project inspiring her future geometrical work and practice with copper wire.</p>
<p>In 2011, Alice Anderson developed a technique of weaving that consists of winding copper wire around objects which appear ‘mummified’ upon completion. In 2012 she founded the Travelling Studio, an itinerant space establishing connections between people, communities and cultures. The Studio aims to create an collective archaeology of the present by recording with woven wire significant objects as witnesses of our time.</p>

"2529","/press/come-and-be-dazzled-wellcome-collection%E2%80%99s-spring-weekend-%E2%80%98-light%E2%80%99","Come and be dazzled by Wellcome Collection’s spring weekend ‘On Light’","<p>Wellcome Collection and UCL will host a dazzling extended weekend of free events and activity this May to mark the International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies. ‘On Light’ will illuminate our human relationship with light with four days of performance, discussion, activity and art. Artists and academics will come together to explore the significance of light in human life, to interrogate how it feeds, fascinates and inspires us, and reflect on its influence over our health and happiness.</p>
<p>The ambitious programme will bring together over 60 contributors, from performance artists and storytellers to engineers and architects. It will be the first all-building event at Wellcome Collection since its expansion, completed in February 2015.</p>
<p>The weekend will begin on Friday 1 May with a late event at Wellcome Collection, when visitors can seek out performances and installations from renowned artists such as Fevered Sleep and Mariele Neudecker, listen to a talk by cosmologist Andrew Pontzen, or enjoy a drink at a pop-up bar. The event will range across five floors, filling the expanded event spaces and new galleries which have doubled the venue’s capacity for live events. In the darkened Auditorium the Pars Foundation will lead a captive audience through an audio performance of music, poetry and science, while up in the transformed Reading Room award winning storytellers The Crick Crack Club will enchant audiences with myths of the sun, the moon and the stars.</p>
<p>On Saturday 2 May UCL will throw open the doors of the Institute of Making for a day of investigations into materials that we use to make and manipulate light, from Ballotini glass beads and invisible balls, to cats eyes and road markings. Elsewhere on Malet Place, UCL researchers will host a colourful street fair of activities, including the chance to take part in a record breaking attempt to create the world’s largest cyanotype print.</p>
<p>A changing, eclectic selection of free ticketed and drop-in events will run throughout Saturday, Sunday and Monday at Wellcome Collection. Visitors may catch a one-off discussion with a Wellcome Collection conservator on Sunday and return to hear sociologist Simon Carter explore popular attitudes to sunshine and health, from sanatoria to cheap travel, on Monday. Other installations will run across the four days. For his installation ‘Non In Luce’ artist Andy Field will invite audiences to work together to create a model-city in complete darkness, finding a new way to communicate without the light of an electrical bulb or the glow of a digital device. The city will be built for the first three days of the event, before the finished landscape is lit for a new audience on the final day.</p>
<p>Rosie Stanbury, Events Manager at Wellcome Collection, said ‘‘On Light’ is a bold and exciting event that will fill our newly expanded venue with an invigorating mix of activities, art and people. Our collaboration with UCL is a brilliant opportunity to extend our programming into the local area, to celebrate the rich history of Bloomsbury and the UCL Museums and the world class academic research that takes place at the University, all just a short walk from Wellcome Collection.’</p>
<p>Simon Cane, Director of UCL Public and Cultural Engagement, said ‘UCL is delighted to be collaborating with the Wellcome Collection on the upcoming ‘On Light’ weekender. Researchers and academics are involved across the university, from the Slade School of Art and Institute of Sustainable Heritage, to the department of Electric and Electronic Engineering, as well as activities from UCL Museums and the Institute of Making. The theme has really caught our imagination, and we look forward to sharing it with the public in May.’</p>
<p>‘On Light’ runs from Friday 1 May to Monday 4 May. All events are free. For tickets and information see <a href=""/onlight"">our website</a>.</p>

<li>Scott Stossel is the editor of The Atlantic. Previously, he was the executive editor of The American Prospect. He is also the author of Sarge: The Life and Times of Sargent Shriver. A graduate of Harvard, he lives with his family in Washington DC.</li>
</ul><p><strong>All My Puny Sorrows by Miriam Toews (Faber)</strong></p>
<ul><li>All My Puny Sorrows by Miriam Toews is a story of sisters, suicide and how to carry on with hope when grief loads the heart.</li>
<li>Miriam Toews (pronounced tâves) was born in 1964 in the small Mennonite town of Steinbach, Manitoba, in Canada. She has published six novels - including A Boy of Good Breeding, A Complicated Kindness, The Flying Troutmans, Irma Voth All My Puny Sorrows - and a memoir of her father, Swing Low.

"2479","/press/bigger-bolder-braver-wellcome-collection-opens-new-spaces-after-%C2%A3175million-development","Bigger, Bolder, Braver: Wellcome Collection opens new spaces after £17.5million development","<p>Wellcome Collection, the destination for the incurably curious, has opened new galleries and spaces following a major expansion of the venue by Stirling Prize winning architects Wilkinson Eyre. The £17.5m development has delivered a bigger and bolder Wellcome Collection, bringing more areas of the building into public use, creating a new gallery for thematic exhibitions and doubling the capacity for public events. A dramatic new spiral staircase links three levels of public spaces and moving up through the building, each floor offers a greater depth of engagement with the venue's programme and collections.</p>
<p>The expansion, which began in 2013, responds to overwhelming demand for Wellcome Collection’s interdisciplinary programme, which explores the connections between medicine, life and art. The venue’s most popular exhibition, 'Death: A Self-portrait', saw over 1500 visitors a day throughout its run, and talks and events are routinely booked out. Its current exhibition 'The Institute of Sexology' is heavily over-subscribed. Wellcome Collection was originally designed for 100,000 yearly visits, but before development works began the venue welcomed more than 550,000 people a year to its critically acclaimed programme and spaces and the Wellcome Library.</p>
<p>The development opens up 40% more gallery space and the extended programme has been modelled to encourage deeper engagement with the venue’s collections and content. A new thematic gallery hosts exhibitions over a year-long period, with a mixture of semi-permanent displays and exhibits that will be developed during the run of a show. The first of these longer exhibitions, 'The Institute of Sexology', open now, explores the history of the study of sex. The ground floor temporary exhibition gallery reopens with ‘Forensics: The anatomy of crime’ - the first time that two major temporary exhibitions will run simultaneously at the venue.</p>
<p>The Wellcome Library’s Reading Room has been transformed into an innovative social space, a hybrid of gallery, library and event space sitting at the heart of the building and forming a bridge between the research Library and the public galleries. The space contains a curated and permanent collection of artworks, items from Henry Wellcome’s own collection, handling objects, books and reproductions of rare manuscripts. The display opens Wellcome Library’s extraordinarily rich collections to new audiences and offers an open invitation to visitors to indulge their curiosity and explore what it means to be human. The research Library has also been expanded, offering scholars and readers an outstanding environment for study, with a larger rare materials room and new spaces for desks and open-access shelving.</p>
<p>The Reading Room will also host live events, complementing the programme of activities, talks and discussions that take place in Wellcome Collection’s forum and auditorium. A dedicated youth Studio now offers a flexible workshop and display space for Youth Programme activities and projects.</p>
<p>Further up the building, The Hub at Wellcome Collection, a new space for interdisciplinary research, will catalyse research and public engagement collaborations between bright minds across specialisms, with grants being made available for group residencies. The first residents, the Hubbub group, are leading an exploration of rest and its opposites.</p>
<p>Wellcome Café on the ground floor is joined by a new restaurant, Wellcome Kitchen, at the top of the new stair. The restaurant offers full waiter table service daily for morning coffee, lunch and afternoon tea and dinner on Thursday evenings.</p>
<p>Clare Matterson, Director of Strategy at the Wellcome Trust says: “Since opening Wellcome Collection seven years ago we’ve been thrilled time and again by the extraordinary public response to our cultural explorations of science, history, art and health. Our beautiful helical stair breathes new life into our building by transporting visitors to expanded galleries and spaces where we will take every opportunity to experiment with new ideas and activities and add to the rich legacy of Sir Henry Wellcome’s curious intellect, research and collections.”</p>
<p>Ken Arnold, Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection, says: “Just as our spectacular new stairs offer different glimpses of our exhibitions and collections from almost every tread, so Wellcome Collection’s new, larger incarnation marks Wellcome Collection out as a space where curious minds can find even more diverse, fresh and often unexpected perspectives on what makes us human. We hope that our new exhibition, gallery and programming formats reward and inspire our ever growing numbers of visitors.”</p>
<p>Simon Chaplin, Director of Culture and Society at the Wellcome Trust, says: “In its new incarnation Wellcome Collection has blurred the boundaries between exhibitions space, events venue and library. Our collections explore health across every period of human culture, from every part of the world - from medieval scrolls to MRI scans. Our exciting new spaces will encourage our visitors to discover the depth and breadth of the rich resources we hold, and to share their discoveries with others. ”</p>

<p>Following a £17.5million development, Wellcome Collection opens a major exhibition exploring the history, science and art of forensic medicine. ‘Forensics: The anatomy of crime’ travels from crime scene to courtroom, across centuries and continents, exploring the specialisms of those involved in the delicate processes of collecting, analysing and presenting medical evidence. It draws out the stories of victims, suspects and investigators of violent crimes and our enduring cultural fascination with death and detection.</p>
<p>The exhibition contains original evidence, archival material, photographic documentation, film footage, forensic instruments and specimens, and is rich with artworks offering both unsettling and intimate responses to traumatic events. Challenging familiar views of forensic medicine shaped by fictions inspired by the sensational reporting of late Victorian murder cases and popular crime dramas, ‘Forensics’ highlights the complex entwining of law and medicine, and the scientific methods it calls upon and creates. It surveys real cases involving forensic advances, including the Dr Crippen trial and the Ruxton murders, pioneers of forensic investigation from Alphonse Bertillon, Mathieu Orfila and Edmond Locard to Alec Jeffreys, and the voices of experts working in the field today.</p>
<p>The first of five sections in the exhibition, ‘The Crime Scene’, investigates the different techniques of recording the location of a crime and its power both as a repository of evidence to be examined and a haunting site of memory. Representations of crimes and death scenes include sketches from the site of a murder attributed to Jack the Ripper, the work of Alphonse Bertillon, whose ‘God’s eye view’ brought methodological rigour to the new possibilities offered by photography, and Frances Glessner Lee’s Nutshell studies: intricate dioramas of domestic crime scenes built in the 1950s and still in use as training devices. Corinne May Botz’s large scale photographs magnify Glessner Lee’s miniature worlds to an unnervingly human scale, whilst artist Teresa Margolles brings a literal murder scene into the gallery, laying out the floor tiles on which a friend was killed.</p>
<p>The crucial clues offered by decomposition are explored both through the work of modern day forensic entomologists and texts and paintings which offer a history of our understanding of decay, from an exquisite ‘Kusōzu’ sequence of 18th century Japanese watercolours detailing the physical deterioration of a dead noble women in nine paintings, to Sally Mann’s arresting portraits of open air ‘body farms’ in Tennessee, where corpses are laid out in different outdoor settings for the purposes of study.</p>
<p>‘The Morgue’ traces a history of pathology, from Song Ci’s 13th century Chinese text ‘The Washing Away of Wrongs’, often seen as the first guide to forensics, to the celebrity pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury, a selection of whose autopsy note cards are displayed for the first time. From a space for viewing corpses in Paris (the word morgue comes from morguer, ‘to peer’) to the virtual autopsies afforded by MRI, CT and 3D scanning, the morgue offers a vital space for questioning the dead. This silent exchange and the apparatus that enables it is recorded in the exhibition through damaged human remains, wound illustrations, weapons and post mortem tools, whilst the clinically direct morgue photographs of Jeffrey Silverthorne attest to the delicate threshold between life and death.</p>
<p>Edmond Locard founded the first police crime laboratory in early 20th century Lyon and his simple theory that ‘every contact leaves a trace’ (now known as the exchange principle) guides the array of disciplines, including serology, toxicology, microscopy, criminal profiling and DNA analysis that feature in ‘The Laboratory’. A succession of identifying and classifying techniques from Bertillon’s mug shots and physiognomic charts, Edward Henry’s fingerprint classification and Alec Jeffreys’ first genetic fingerprint, sit alongside the trace evidence techniques of blood and poison analysis that made traceless crimes visible.</p>
<p>Reconstructions of movement and identity required in looking for missing people are considered in ‘The Search’, both through individual cases and mass disappearances. A newly commissioned artwork for the exhibition by Šejla Kamerić seeks to recover human stories behind the critical mass of statistics and data generated by the on-going identification of massacre victims in the 1992 -95 Bosnian war. The work of forensic anthropologists and archaeologists is reflected through troubling artworks exploring facial reconstruction, by Christine Borland, sexual violence, by Jenny Holzer and, in the portraits and film of Alfredo Jaar and Patricio Guzmán, genocide in Rwanda and political disappearances in Chile. These unsettling pieces trace different and urgent searches for justice, reparation and restitution of identity in the face of personal and political atrocities.</p>
<p>‘The Courtroom’ marks the final test of forensic medicine’s success as evidence is gathered and presented in pursuit of justice. Forensic investigation has transformed the courtroom, but expert witnesses are subject to the less certain territory of performance when presenting their findings – a dramatic tension exploited both by charismatic pathologists like Spilsbury and Hollywood scriptwriters. From the Roman forum to the Old Bailey the exhibition closes with the space which brings together the many strands of forensic medicine, either as a conclusion to an investigation, or to contest previous convictions. Taryn Simon’s photographs of wrongly convicted people, at the scenes of crimes they did not commit, gives a final reminder that forensics is an ever evolving field, constantly reviewing its own certainties.</p>
<p>Lucy Shanahan, Curator, says: “This exhibition gives alternative views of the forensic process from the CSI detections of popular fiction and television, whilst exploring the cultural fascination that the disciplines of forensic medicine inspire. Our journey from crime scene to courtroom takes in pioneers of scientific techniques that have revolutionised the way in which crimes are investigated, and offers visitors unexpected encounters with the changing relationship between medicine, law and society.”</p>
<p>Ken Arnold, Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection says: “‘Forensics’ reminds us of the human body’s extraordinary capacity to leave traces beyond death and disappearance. This unsettling truth is both the focus of an astonishing range of scientific enquiry and fertile territory for the cultural imagination. Challenging, affecting, at once familiar and disquieting, it’s a perfect subject for Wellcome Collection to explore as it welcomes visitors to its new expanded spaces.”</p>
<p>‘Forensics: The anatomy of crime’ is free and runs from 26 February to 21 June 2015 at Wellcome Collection, 183 Euston Road, London NW1 2BE. A wide programme of events will accompany the exhibition and a publication of the same name by crime writer Val McDermid is available, published by Wellcome Collection and Profile Books, £8.99 Hardback & eBook.</p>

<p>The Wellcome Library will partner with the Borthwick Institute for Archives, London Metropolitan Archives, Dumfries and Galloway Council Archives, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Archives and the Royal College of Psychiatrists for the project, which will bring together documents from the York Retreat, St Luke’s Hospital Woodside, Crichton Royal Hospital, Gartnavel Royal Hospital and Camberwell House Asylum. These collections will be added to the Wellcome Library’s own collection of archives from public and private mental health institutions, including the records of Ticehurst House Hospital in Sussex, which provide a rare insight into the running of a privately-run asylum.</p>
<p>The project will focus on records dating from the 19th and 20th century, and will touch on the movement away from institutional care as the 20th century progressed. Patient records and case notes, photographs, administrative documents and registers will be digitised, creating an extensive online archive that will be a valuable resource for historical research.</p>
<p>The documents will be available via the Wellcome Library’s website, where users will be able to search the archives using the catalogue and view documents on the media player. The documents will be published under CC-BY or CC-BY-NC licence, allowing users to view, download, reproduce and distribute the material.</p>
<p>As well as official documents, the archives contain artwork and publications produced by patients and staff. These include copies of ‘The New Moon’, a monthly publication produced at the Crichton Royal Hospital, and ‘The Gartnavel Minstrel’, the earliest example of a publication written and edited by hospital patients. Such documents give a rare and often poignant insight into the lives of those who lived in the hospitals, including details of theatricals and concerts, trips and sports fixtures. In the archives of the Retreat a handwritten paper entitled “Our very mixed cricket” gives a humorous account of a mixed cricket match held at the hospital in the early 1900s.</p>
<p>Also included are important documents relating to revelations of mistreatment at some asylums in the early 1800s and subsequent reforms. The Borthwick Institute for Archives will digitise tracts on the York Asylum controversies, 1813-15, in which abuses at that institution became the centre of a national public debate, sparking a campaign of reform. From St Luke’s Hospital Woodside, a visitors book kept between 1829 and 1891 records the comments of notable visitors such as the Quaker social reformer Elizabeth Fry and the author Charles Dickens, who after a visit on 15 January 1858 noted “the great improvements in the hospital…[and the] wise spirit of the whole administration”.</p>
<p>Simon Chaplin, Head of the Wellcome Library, said: “This partnership will bring some rare and important historical material from a fascinating period of medical history into an open and free online resource. Broadening access to such collections is at the heart of the Wellcome Library’s digitisation project and we are delighted that others are joining with us to make this possible.”</p>
<p>Work to digitise the archives began in autumn 2014 and will take two years to complete. The project will be fully funded by the Wellcome Library. The University of Glasgow Digitisation Centre will digitise all material from the Dumfries and Galloway Council Archives and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.</p>
<p>The Wellcome Library began its digitisation programme in 2010; its ambition is to make freely available over 50 million pages of historic medical books, archives, manuscripts and journals by 2020.</p>
<p>The Wellcome Library’s media player allows the close reading, downloading and embedding of digitised files, including cover-to-cover books, archives, works of art, videos and audio files. It was developed by Digirati for the Wellcome Library and the software is freely available for anyone to download and use under an MIT Open Source license.</p>

"2268","/press/hubbub-modern-life-explored-new-%C2%A31million-wellcome-collection-residency-begins","Hubbub in modern life explored as new £1million Wellcome Collection residency begins","<p>The urge to be busy defines modern life. Rest can seem hard to find, whether in relation to an exhausted body, a racing mind or a hectic city. Should we slow down, or should we embrace intense activity? What effects do each of these states have on the health of our bodies and minds? A new research group called Hubbub have taken residence at Wellcome Collection and are bringing together scientists, humanists, artists, clinicians, public health experts, broadcasters and public engagement professionals to breathe new life into the questions we ask about rest and busyness.</p>
<p>The group are the first occupants of a new dedicated space, The Hub at Wellcome Collection, designed to house two-year long interdisciplinary projects exploring medicine, health and wellbeing. A core team of five, led by social scientist Felicity Callard (Durham University), have been awarded a £1million grant and will work with over 40 partners of rich variety to explore the dynamics of rest, tumult, activity and work, as they operate in mental health, neuroscience, the arts and everyday life. Other core members are psychologist and writer Charles Fernyhough (Durham University), broadcaster Claudia Hammond (BBC's All in the Mind and Health Check), neuroscientist Daniel Margulies (Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences) and poet James Wilkes (Durham University).</p>
<p>Hubbub will have freedom to explore and develop research and public outputs over their residency, staging experiments, exhibitions, events and broadcasts. It is hoped that the use of different modes of investigation will produce a novel archive about rest and activity in early twenty-first century city life, and offer unexpected avenues for academic and creative inquiry, clinical practice and public policy. A core cohort of London participants will be recruited during the residency to help study different cultures of rest, with investigations crossing the arts, psychology, neuroscience and the social sciences.</p>
<p>Partners from diverse specialisms will explore how divisions between the ‘resting’ and ‘non-resting’ mind and body are understood and lived at different historical moments and by different kinds of people. The group will examine the many attempts to map activity, noise, clamour and silence across space at different scales, from cartography to self-monitoring to brain mapping, and interrogate different methods and data sets, entangling micro-scale geometric data on city noise, ‘noisy’ brain data and artistic mappings of sound and silence.</p>

<p>Felicity Callard, Hubbub group leader, says: “It is a great honour to have been selected as the first residents of this flagship space for interdisciplinary research. The Hub offers a unique opportunity to be experimental in all senses of the word – and we are enormously excited at the thought of bringing new ideas and things into the world through entangling the experimental practices of artists, scientists, humanists, public engagement professionals and, indeed, of diverse Londoners. The search for rest in a world of tumult, busyness and noise preoccupies many of us. Our two years in The Hub will allow us the space and time both to investigate this common, but complex, desire and to uncover the multiple ways in which people find – or don’t find – ways of satisfying it.”</p>
<p>Ken Arnold, Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection, says: “Hubbub promises a thrilling commingling of creative minds, of thinkers and makers. It’s a collaborative project of dizzying variety in search of answers to questions that are pressing to all of us caught up within the tumult of modern life. We have established the Hub as part of an expanded Wellcome Collection to foster unexpected and original research and activity and we look forward to being surprised and enriched by the work Felicity Callard and her group will nurture during their residency.”</p>
<p>Hubbub are residents of the Hub at Wellcome Collection between October 2014 and July 2016</p>

"846","/press/million-page-story-modern-genetics-launched-wellcome-library","Million-page story of modern genetics launched by the Wellcome Library","<p>The papers of the pioneers of modern genetics - including Francis Crick, James D Watson, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin - have been collected together for the first time and made freely available in a £ 3.9 million digitisation project from the Wellcome Library.</p>
<p>Codebreakers: Makers of modern genetics, which launches today at <a href=""http://wellcomelibrary.org/codebreakers"">wellcomelibrary.org/codebreakers</a>, contains more than one million pages of first-hand notes, letters, sketches, lectures, photographs and essays from the circle of brilliant minds responsible for uncovering the structure of DNA. The site lays bare the personal and professional thoughts, rivalries, blind alleys and breakthroughs of the scientists whose ideas transformed our understanding of the matter of life.</p>
<p>Drawing on five partner archives in the USA, London, Cambridge and Glasgow and the Wellcome Library's own holdings, Codebreakers offers an unparalleled and comprehensive primary resource for researchers and curious minds across the world and is launched ahead of the 60th anniversary of Crick and Watson's seminal 'Nature' paper revealing the structure of DNA. It holds the stories behind the discovery, which has shaped our genetic age, from diagnosis to drug development and from forensics to food production, and which lies at the heart of today's biomedical research.</p>
<p>The vast collections contain iconic documents - such as Crick's preliminary sketches of the double helix and Franklin's X-ray diffraction 'photo 51' - and everyday exchanges. The biological revolutions of the 1950s and 1960s, together with their legacies in the fields of medical genetics and genomics, are recorded in the scientists' own words and placed in the context of earlier research into the links between heredity and health, including the archives of the Eugenics Society, one of the most influential scientific organisations of the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Codebreakers sits within an entirely redesigned Wellcome Library website, and a new media player allows the close reading, downloading and embedding of digitised files. The content is free to all, and users can log in using Library membership, Facebook or Twitter accounts. A timeline and essays on key individuals and research groups offer navigational aids through the records.</p>
<p>Codebreakers is a collaborative project, uniting collections from five internationally important centres. Working with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Churchill Archives Centre Cambridge, the University of Glasgow, King's College London and UCL, the digitised papers of James D Watson, Rosalind Franklin, Sydney Brenner, Lionel Penrose, J B S Haldane, Guido Pontecorvo, James Harrison Renwick, Malcolm Ferguson-Smith and Maurice Wilkins have been made available. They join material from the Wellcome Library's own holdings, including the papers of Francis Crick, Fred Sanger, Arthur Ernest Mourant, Peter Medawar, Hans Grü neberg, Honor Fell and Gerard Wyatt.</p>
<p>Users exploring the site will find treasures of beauty - such as Honor Fell's minutely observed cell drawings - and import, including richly annotated holographs of key papers and lectures unlocking the secrets of DNA. The archives are full of candid correspondence, keen professional insight and moving personal items, such as Peter Medawar's self-portraits, which were drawn after suffering a stroke.</p>
<p>Simon Chaplin, Head of the Wellcome Library says: ""Codebreakers reveals the extraordinarily convoluted networks of influence, insight and inspiration that lie behind crucial moments of scientific discovery. It is a project made possible by a creative partnership with five outstanding libraries and archives, sharing a goal of free and open access. Together, our collections offer an extraordinarily rich research resource documenting one of the most significant periods of scientific innovation in human history.""</p>
<p>The Wellcome Library's Codebreakers project is the first phase of a major digitisation programme that will create integrated online content, featuring digitised books, archives, films, photographs and audio covering every aspect of the history of medicine and biomedical science. A further half million pages will be added to Codebreakers over the next six months, and £ 5.8 million has been set aside for the next phase of the Library's digitisation plans, which focus on material relating to neurology and mental health. The Library itself is also expanding as part of a £ 17.5-million development of Wellcome Collection due for completion in summer 2014.</p>

"844","/press/souzou-outsider-art-japan","Souzou: Outsider Art from Japan","<p>Wellcome Collection's spring exhibition, 'Souzou: Outsider Art from Japan', brings together more than 300 works for the first major display of Japanese Outsider Art in the UK. The 46 artists represented in the show are residents and attendees of social welfare institutions across the main island of Honshu, and they present diverse bodies of work including ceramics, textiles, paintings, sculpture and drawings. 'Souzou' is a word that has no direct translation in English but a dual meaning in Japanese. It can be written two ways, meaning either 'creation' or 'imagination'. Both allude to a force by which new ideas are born and take shape in the world.</p>
<p>Organised in association with Het Dolhuys, the Museum of Psychiatry in Haarlem (the Netherlands) and the Social Welfare Organisation Aiseikai (Tokyo), the exhibition reflects the growing popularity of and acclaim for Outsider Art - often defined as works made by self-taught artists perceived to be at the margins of society - while questioning assumptions about the category itself. Eschewing a purely biographical approach, the show is object-led, with a startling array of works offering singular and affecting explorations of culture, memory and creativity.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">The exhibition records both intimately personal and expansive approaches to creating art and the processes of making, through six overlapping sections. 'Language' explores the creative release of visual expression for artists for whom verbal or written communication is challenging or impossible. Works range from Takanori Herai's diary of hieroglyphics to Toshiko Yamanishi's kaleidoscopic love letters to her mother, which express depth of emotion through movement and colour rather than words. Ryoko Koda's intricate cityscapes are composed of a single symbol, resembling a fictional character from the Japanese alphabet, while Hiroyuki Komatsu's work recalls word-for-word the dialogue of his favourite TV programmes. 'Making' looks at engagement with material, the repeated use of particular and unusual media, and the meditative and therapeutic aspects of creativity. Koichi Fujino's immersive ink paintings cover every inch of the paper, Yumiko Kawai's textile landscapes are built up through repeated freehand circular stitching and Shota Katsube's repurposing of wire ties creates a vast yet diminutive army of action figures: all these pieces are marked by the occupation and passing of time.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Works in 'Representation' and 'Relationships' reflect the things and people surrounding the artists, often taking surprising and curious forms. The eerie pastel still lifes of Takashi Shuji and abstract assemblages of Takanari Nitta hold an ethereal, otherworldly quality but are inspired by everyday objects, while Satoshi Nishikawa's surreal sculptures of fruit are made entirely from dense aggregates of small ceramic rabbits. Takako Shibata's expansive and repeated portraits freeze her absent mother in time, while Sakiko Kono's dolls - representing friends and carers in the facility where she resides - grow in size and stature according to the levels of her affection. Dreams and desire figure strongly with idealised self-projections in the work of Yoko Kubota and Masao Obata, Nobuji Higa's highly stylised and sexualised nudes and Marie Suzuki's darkly dystopian drawings exploring female sexuality and gender. Self-expression is framed through physical and emotional environments, but interpreted in richly imaginative and sometimes fantastical forms.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">The absorption, reflection and acute observation evident in 'Culture' contests the myth of Outsider Art as being solely reflective of the interior mind. Daisuke Kibushi's immaculately rendered postwar movie posters, copied from memory, Keisuke Ishino's origami figurines and Ryosuke Otsuji's ceramic Okinawan lions all attest to a sharp awareness of the cultural contexts and traditions of Japanese society. The final section, 'Possibility', feature works that seek to comprehend and reorder the surrounding world. Koichiro Miya explores notions of ability, disability and super-ability with statistic-strewn works, Shingo Ikeda's beautiful notebook infographics calculate the endless possibilities of subway journeys he might make, and Norimitsu Kokubo's densely sketched cartographies imagine real places through information gleaned online, reframing the world through a keen and creative curiosity.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Shamita Sharmacharja, Curator at Wellcome Collection, says: ""We are delighted to be staging the first substantial exhibition of Japanese Outsider Art in the UK. This is a show that will reward inquisitive minds, with astonishing levels of creativity and resource at play in exhibited pieces. These diverse bodies of work offer unique visions of the world, richly expressed, which we hope will move, surprise and inspire visitors.""</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">A series of documentary films featuring a selection of the exhibiting artists will play at the end of the exhibition.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">'Souzou: Outsider Art from Japan' runs from 28 March to 30 June 2013 at Wellcome Collection, 183 Euston Road, NW1 2BE.</p>

<h2><strong>Notes for editors</strong></h2>
<p>'Souzou: Outsider Art from Japan' is curated by Shamita Sharmacharja, with exhibition design by Jane Holmes and graphics by Martin McGrath. It is organised in association with Het Dolhuys, the Museum of Psychiatry in Haarlem (the Netherlands), which staged a version of this exhibition in 2012, and the Social Welfare Organisation Aiseikai (Tokyo).</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">The artists in this exhibition have been diagnosed with a variety of different behavioural and developmental disorders and mental illnesses and are residents or day attendees of specialist care institutions.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">The phrase 'Outsider Art' is an approximation of another term that does not translate comfortably into English. Coined by British academic Roger Cardinal in 1972, 'Outsider Art' follows French artist Jean Dubuffet's theory of Art Brut, put forward in 1945, meaning a 'raw art', that was 'uncooked' or uncontaminated by culture. Outsider Art has since become an internationally recognised term, commonly used to describe work made by artists who have received little or no tuition but produce work for the sake of creation alone, without an audience in mind, and who are perceived to inhabit the margins of mainstream society.</p>

<p>Aiseikai was established in 1958 as a rehabilitation home facility, providing care and vocational training, initially for girls, then adults with mental illnesses. After 2000 services were expanded to include day care, in-home long-term care services as well as consultation support and Aiseikai became the central provider of care and support for the community of Nakano-city, Tokyo Metropolitan Area. In 2012 it established a Projects and Planning Enterprise Division, with the objective of raising awareness of Outsider Art (and art and culture as a whole). Aiseikai sees new opportunities to enrich local community life through the fusion of art and culture with social welfare, and strives to connect lives and foster cohesion in the community.</p>
<p>Het Dolhuys is located in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area in the city of Haarlem, the Netherlands. It is a unique museum housed in a building which carries 500 years of healthcare history. Once a leprosy ward and chapel (1319) it was extended to become the city asylum and was until 1998 a psychiatric crises intervention centre. This 'architecture of exclusion' is now a vivid cultural destination focusing on inclusion and fighting stigma. As the only independent psychiatry museum in Europe it shows how 'abnormality' was treated in the past and questions the notions on 'normality' in the present.

Bodily pain is not only physical, it's cultural too. Join a prominent group of thought leaders on Friday 7- Saturday 8 December at Wellcome Collection to probe the meanings of pain over two stimulating days of poetry, film, music, lectures and discussion.</p>
<p>Nearly everyone has experienced bodily pain. Yet describing it is notoriously difficult. In 1930, Virginia Woolf lamented that even a ""schoolgirl, when she falls in love, has Shakespeare and Keats to speak her mind for her but let a sufferer try to describe a pain in his head to a doctor and language at once runs dry"".</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Is pain really so difficult to articulate? Or can it actually generate creative expression? If so, what do these narratives tell us about the meaning of pain? Some believe it has the power to purge sin others interpret it as an unjust punishment. Pain might even be regarded as intrinsic to achievement - ""no pain, no gain"". 'Pain and its Meanings' will bring together creative and scholarly minds to explore the relationship between body, mind and culture.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">The event begins on Friday 7 December with an evening of poetry, music and film. In addition to the screening of a short film, 'face2face, duet for pain', by visual artist Deborah Padfield, new works by Costa prize-winning poet Jo Shapcott and composer Daniel Eisner Harle will be presented.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">The following day, Saturday 8 December, is devoted to discussion and a programme of public lectures that will be given by world-class scholars, writers and clinicians. A leading spokesperson on disability issues, Tom Shakespeare, will open the day with a personal account on disability and its discontents, followed by medical sociologist Gillian Bendelow, who will focus on chronic pain and the mind/body problem in health and illness. Historian Javier Moscoso will consider pain and social awareness, and NHS consultant Joanna Zakrzewska will give the final morning presentation examining issues around pain and identity within a clinical setting.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Pain is one of the most influential forces in history, yet we still know remarkably little about how people experienced it in the past. Joanna Bourke will begin the afternoon session by exploring questions around the nature of suffering from the 1760s to the present, followed by presentations from renowned novelists and cultural critics Sarah Dunant and Marina Warner. Thought-provoking round-table forums will be held at the end of the morning and afternoon sessions.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Justify"">Joanna Bourke, facilitator of the symposium and Professor of History at Birkbeck, University of London, said ""In my research, I am forever asking: What is this experience of pain? How do we communicate it? What does it mean? How do we empathise with sufferers? This event is intended to confront some of these questions, head on. It will bring together new and different perspectives from those who work with people-in-pain, both past and present, and who, of course, experience pain themselves. We hope to encourage new ways of thinking about suffering.""</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Rosie Stanbury, Events Manager at Wellcome Collection, said ""'Pain and its Meanings' takes a familiar subject that all of us have experience of, and turns it around so that we consider it from a new perspective. Our event will encourage members of the audience to reflect on this fascinating topic, which will ask how and why we give meaning to bodily pain.""</p>

"841","/press/wellcome-collection-unveils-%C2%A3175-million-development-plans","Wellcome Collection unveils £17.5 million development plans","<p>Wellcome Collection today unveiled a major £17.5m development project, creating new galleries and spaces to meet overwhelming demand. The venue welcomed its two-millionth visitor this summer, shortly after the fifth anniversary of its opening.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Stirling Prize winning architects Wilkinson Eyre will transform the venue, bringing new areas into public use and linking the layers of Wellcome Collection activity with a dramatic new spiral staircase and interconnected galleries. The development, due for completion in summer 2014, aims to create a truly interdisciplinary and curiosity-driven cultural destination dedicated to inspiring wider and deeper engagement with the connections between medicine, life and art.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Visitor numbers in the five years since Wellcome Collection opened demonstrate a real hunger for innovative science-based cultural experience that is currently under-served. This year has seen the venue's most popular ever exhibition, Brains, bring a 20% increase in footfall, and the busiest summer since opening: talks and events are routinely over-subscribed. Wellcome Collection was originally designed to accommodate 100,000 yearly visits from the 'incurably curious'. Over the last year the venue has welcomed 490,000 people to its critically acclaimed programme of events and exhibitions, the world class Wellcome Library and a unique range of event spaces for hire.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">The development will open up 30% more gallery space and double the capacity for public events. A major new thematic gallery will hold in-depth exhibitions over a year-long period, with a mixture of semi-permanent displays and exhibits that will be conceived and developed during the run of the show. A dedicated youth events studio will offer an activity space for 14-19 year olds to engage with and produce work that contributes to the Wellcome Collection programme.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Central to the project, the Wellcome Library's iconic Reading Room will be transformed into an innovative public space, bridging the gap between the Library's research community and the public and opening its extraordinarily rich collections to new audiences. This new space will sit at the heart of the building and be curated with events and displays of books and objects from the collection combined with state of the art technology exploiting the Library's ambitious digitisation programme. The research Library will also grow, offering scholars and readers an outstanding environment for study, with an expansion of its rare materials room and new spaces for desks and open-access shelving.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">The Hub at Wellcome Collection, a new space for interdisciplinary research, will catalyse research and public engagement collaborations between the brightest minds across specialisms, with grants being made available for group residencies. An events series, Spotlight, will also be established, offering a forum for experts from different disciplines to come together and debate key topics and policy issues affecting medicine, science and society.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">A new restaurant, in addition to the current café , will significantly increase the catering offer at Wellcome Collection.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Major works on the development will begin in summer 2013, with completion scheduled for summer 2014. Wellcome Collection plans to remain open to the public throughout the build, with a flexible programme of events and displays.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Clare Matterson, Director of Medical Humanities and Engagement at the Wellcome Trust says: ""The phenomenal success of Wellcome Collection over the last five years is a wonderful affirmation of our conviction that adults are interested and inspired by complex themes that make connections across science, history, art and health. Each part of our new development adds to the legacy of Sir Henry Wellcome&rsquo s intellectual curiosity, his research and collections. Our new galleries and spaces will surprise and inspire our visitors with new connections and ideas and respond to the debates they provoke.""</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Ken Arnold, Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection, says: ""Our new thematic gallery and youth events studio will give a greater depth to the Wellcome Collection experience and allow us to experiment across our programmes with bold new exhibition and event formats. The spaces will allow us to challenge and inspire the curious minds of our growing number of visitors.""</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Simon Chaplin, Head of the Wellcome Library, says: ""Libraries are laboratories for the mind. Our collections explore the place of health in every period of human culture, from every part of the world - from Egyptian papyri to MRI scans. Opening this fabulous resource more widely to the public will stimulate and reward the curiosity of our visitors, creating a new community bound by their interest in creating and sharing ideas.""</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Jim Eyre, Director, Wilkinson Eyre Architects, says: ""This project represents an exciting and challenging opportunity to provide new and expanded facilities that will enable visitors to connect fully with Wellcome Collection. The upper floors will be served by means of a dynamic new staircase appearing in the entrance hall drawing people in and up and bringing the many different parts of the building together.""</p>

"840","/press/death-richard-harris-collection","Death: The Richard Harris Collection","<h2>Wellcome Collection | 15 November 2012- 24 February 2013</h2>
<p>Wellcome Collection's major winter exhibition 'Death: A self-portrait' showcases some 300 works from a unique collection devoted to the iconography of death and our complex and contradictory attitudes towards it. Assembled by Richard Harris, a former antique print dealer based in Chicago, the collection is spectacularly diverse, including art works, historical artefacts, anatomical illustrations and ephemera from across the world.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Rare prints by Rembrandt, Dürer and Goya are displayed alongside anatomical drawings, war art and antique metamorphic postcards human remains are juxtaposed with Renaissance vanitas paintings and twentieth century installations celebrating Mexico's Day of the Dead. From a group of ancient Incan skulls, to a spectacular chandelier made of 3000 plaster-cast bones by British artist Jodie Carey, this singular collection, by turns disturbing, macabre and moving, opens a window upon our enduring desire to make peace with death.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Over five themed rooms, the exhibition investigates the value of art in evolving ideas about death and the body. Contemplating Death explores the pressing of our own mortality upon us, through memento mori which range across media and centuries to include works by Warhol, van Utrecht and Mapplethorpe, together with exquisite netsuke miniatures and porcelain, bronze, and ivory skulls. The Dance of Death focuses on the levelling universality of death, from the iconography of the medieval 'Danse Macabre', which emerged in a landscape of plague, famine and war, to the entwined skeletons who dance through Tibetan Chitipati art. Death appears in various guises: triumphant at the head of a procession, as a benign skeleton playing a violin, as friend, enemy and lover, scything through crowds in James Ensor's fin-de-siècle engraving, or perched sadly on a table in June Leaf's delicate contemporary sculpture.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Violent Death is dominated by three groups of works, Jacques Callot's 'The Miseries and Misfortunes of War' (1633), Francisco Goya's 'The Disasters of War' (1810-1820, published 1863) and Otto Dix's 'The War' (1924) - compelling works of chaos, brutality and, more troublingly, aesthetic beauty. This room presents death on an industrial scale, asking how we should respond to art that bears witness to atrocity and horror. Eros and Thanatos presents works which navigate our strange attraction to the outer limits of life and death, sexuality and pain: voluptuous nudes juxtaposed with cadavers, Death interrupting the embrace of lovers, proud anatomists posing with a flayed corpse, amorous couples morphed into grinning skulls - all reflect the morbid excitement of death's proximity. And from the ground-breaking anatomical studies such as Eustachi's 16th-century anatomical engravings and Albinus' 'Atlas' (1747) to John Isaacs' 'Are you still mad at me?' (2001) the dissection knife cuts across lines of desire, death and knowledge.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">The exhibition finds beginnings in ends with Commemoration, which follows some of the globally and historically varied rituals around death, burial and mourning. From a Pacific Island tau tau or grave guardian, pre-Colombian Aztec vessels, to American photographs of individuals posing with macabre props, they all express a very human desire to connect with our ancestors, to sanctify the body, to feel ourselves intimately connected to people beyond death.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Richard Harris' collection is a modern-day cabinet of curiosities and an extended visual essay on our dealings with death across cultures and spiritual traditions. It functions as an autobiography of one individual and his collection but provides a remarkable opportunity to explore and interrogate our own feelings about mortality.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Richard Harris says: ""The collection was from the beginning meant to be shown as an exhibition to the public, never as a private, person statement for my eyes only. I hoped to create a body of work that would chronologically and culturally capture the essence of Death through its iconography, from masterpieces of fine art to the incidental. It is my wish that what started out solely as a collection of objects based on the theme of Death will become the visual component for a more serious conversation about the subject of death that we need to have in our society.""</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"">Kate Forde, Curator at Wellcome Collection says: ""Richard Harris' remarkable collection brings together an extraordinary range of creative responses to death. The artefacts on display connect the living and the dead in a perpetual exchange underwritten by memory and mortality. The exhibition is a testament both to the keen and curious mind of a collector and our imaginative and unending fascination with mortality, across cultures and history. 'Death' challenges us to recognise the many faces of death.""</p>

"836","/press/superhuman","Superhuman","<p>From Icarus to i-Limbs, Wellcome Collection's major summer exhibition, 'Superhuman', explores the extraordinary ways people have sought to improve, adapt and enhance their body's performance. Coinciding with the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games, 'Superhuman' brings together over 100 artworks, artefacts, videos, photographs, comics and medical objects which record our seemingly limitless desire to be more than ourselves. From an ancient Egyptian prosthetic toe to the superheroes of sci-fi imagination and the futuristic promises of nano- and biotechnology, the exhibition takes a long view of physical and chemical enhancement and explores the science, myths and cultural reception of body extension.</p>
<p>Opening with a playful look at what constitutes an enhancement, from everyday objects such as glasses and false teeth to sex aids and iPhones, 'Superhuman' outlines the enormous range of devices with which we adapt our capacity, and investigates the benefits and side effects of their use. Vivienne Westwood's vertiginous 'Super Elevated Gillie' shoes raise their wearer in height, but as Naomi Campbell's catwalk spill famously demonstrated, present challenges in staying upright an 1866 'Punch' illustration of roller skaters run amok speaks to a fear of new technical extensions gaining universal favour contraceptive implants on display delay fertility just as IVF techniques can extend it. We are all, to some extent, superhuman, but our sense of our enhanced selves varies dramatically.</p>
<p>The exhibition explores the long history of prosthetics, both as enabling devices and as covers for society's discomfort with missing body parts. Striking images and artefacts include a 19th-century silver nose attached to spectacles for a women disfigured by syphilis prosthetic legs being parachuted into Afghanistan in Mohsen Makhmalbaf's film, 'Kandahar' James Gillingham&rsquo s arresting studio photographs of Victorian women displaying their artificial limbs but concealing their faces and the extraordinary but clumsy prosthetics developed in an attempt to 'normalise' children affected by thalidomide in the mid-20th century. The third instalment from Matthew Barney's 'Cremaster' series sees model, athlete and double amputee Aimee Mullins performing roles involving beautiful and metamorphic prostheses that grant surreally envisaged super powers. The elaborate man o' war tentacles featured in the work are displayed alongside this rare screening of Barney's film.</p>
<p>'Superhuman' is rich with artworks considering heightened bodily states. Rebecca Horn's delicately menacing appendages in 'Scratching both walls at once' (1974-5) examine the body's occupation of space, and video works by Charlotte Jarvis, Regina José Galindo and Floris Kaayk explore the cultural effects of cosmetic surgery on our psyches and the extremities of potential and actual physical intervention. Dorothy Cross's 'Eyemaker' (2000) follows an ocularist's creation of a glass eye, an object to be seen but never see, and Revital Cohen takes the replacement of body parts to an endpoint in 'The Immortal' (2011), an arrangement of connected life-support machines that continue their biological functions despite the absence of a human body to sustain.</p>
<p>Fritz Khan's 1930s illustration of the body as a palace of industry sets up a familiar modernist model of the human as machine, but 'Superhuman' takes a wider view of the mechanised body, from Ambroise Paré's exquisite 16th-century engraving of a mechanical hand to the microchip inserted into the self-declared cyborg Professor Kevin Warwick. The fraught relationship between the body and technology, and our fears of and hopes for automata, is drawn out through photographs from Yves Gellie's 'Human Version' project, featuring humanoid robots, and Donald Rodney's 'Psalms' (1997) - a fully automated wheelchair which moves around 'Superhuman', created at a time when the artist's debilitating sickle cell anaemia kept him away from the gallery exhibiting his work.</p>
<p>Comics have long worked through fantasies of human transformation and imagined the perils and salvations of super-enhanced human capability. The Invincible Iron Man, the Flash, X, the man with the X-ray eyes, the Savage She-Hulk, Deathlok the Demolisher, the Amazing Spider-Man and Dr Octopus are among the colourful parade of heroes and villains displayed in original editions from Marvel and DC Comics, saving and destroying the world with exaggerated senses and strengths.</p>
<p>As Olympic dreams are made and broken in London, 'Superhuman' looks at the history of adaptions made in pursuit of athletic advantage. When Tom Hicks won the 1904 Olympic marathon he collapsed on the line. The dangerous levels of strychnine found in his body were allowed under the rules of the time, whereas training was strictly limited to four weeks a year. 'Superhuman' considers the cultural and historical variances behind prohibition and the techniques of manipulating bodies for competitive benefit, from the patents of Nike's early waffle sole trainers and the rise of isotonic drinks through debates over blade legs and curious devices such as the Whizzinator: a false penis designed to dodge doping tests by delivering clean urine. The obsessive demands of sporting prowess are further explored through new works by artist and bodybuilder Francesca Steele.</p>
<p>Ethicists, scientists and philosophers are put into video debate in the gallery space about the future of human enhancement. Are desires for self-amendment so intrinsic we can consider bodily extensions as evolutionary progress? Or are these adaptions a denial of what makes us human - more supra than superhuman? Where do the lines between imagination and reality lie in a realm of science that carries the weight of public exhilaration and dread? In 'Superhuman' the exhibition itself is enhanced, with substantial space given over to live performance and events.</p>
<p>Emily Sargent, Curator of 'Superhuman', says: 'Human enhancement is one of the most exciting and feared areas of modern science, where sci-fi imaginings seemingly come alive. But it is not the exclusive preserve of the contemporary technologist, as our desire to enhance ourselves and our ingenuity to do so is in evidence throughout our history.'</p>
<p>Ken Arnold, Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection, says: ""'Superhuman' treads a playful and eclectic path through our craving to be bigger, better, stronger and faster, and finds ever-shifting landscapes in our understanding of what it means to be enhanced. In typical Wellcome Collection fashion, the exhibition offers startling examples of human adaptability and makes us look afresh and with no small wonder at our own bodies.""</p>
<p>'Superhuman' runs from 19 July to 16 October 2012 at Wellcome Collection, 183 Euston Road, NW1 2BE.</p>

"832","/press/brains-mind-matter","Brains: The mind as matter","<h2>Wellcome Collection | 29 March- 17 June 2012</h2>
<p>
	Wellcome Collection's major new exhibition looks at one of the most complex entities in the universe. Brains: The mind as matter (29 March to 17 June 2012) explores what humans have done to brains in the name of medical intervention, scientific enquiry, cultural meaning and technological change. Featuring more than 150 objects including real brains, artworks, manuscripts, artefacts, videos and photography, Brains follows the long quest to manipulate and decipher the most unique and mysterious of human organs, whose secrets continue to confound and inspire.</p>
<p>Brains asks not what brains do for us, but what we have done to brains. Famous and infamous brain specimens - including those of Albert Einstein, Charles Babbage and William Burke - are on display, and the exhibition is filled with thoughts on brains from the brains of famous thinkers, together with donors, surgeons, patients and collectors. Works by contemporary artists including Helen Pynor, Andrew Carnie, Annie Cattrell, Susan Aldworth, Jonathon Keats and Katharine Dowson offer personal responses to the form and physical matter of the organ, while the cultural significance of the rituals, rhetoric and reality of handling brains is explored across centuries.</p>
<p>The exhibition has four sections. The first, Measuring/Classifying, introduces efforts to define the relationship between the brain's function and form. If microscopic cellular staining techniques developed in the late 19th century enabled a new understanding of localised neural processes, the rise of phrenology and anthropometry demonstrates the ease with which societal prejudice fed into analysis of outward brain shape and size. From Bernard Hollander's cranial measuring system to the tools and models of phrenology, used to circumscribe comparative types of humanity, the skewed morality of these pseudo-sciences illustrates the measuring of brains as a measure of culture.</p>
<p>Mapping/Modelling follows the attempts to represent the anatomy of the brain. From early visualisations by Reisch, Vesalius and Descartes in the 16th and 17th centuries, through beautiful 19th century paintings by Charles Bell, to the latest kaleidoscopic Brainbow images of nerve cells created by Jeff Lichtman and his team, the artistic drive to apprehend the complexities of the brain follow the increasing philosophical and medical understanding of its centrality to our being. Wax models, used since antiquity, gain extraordinary intricacy in renderings of the brain, and exquisite, groundbreaking drawings of brain cells by Santiago Ramón y Cajal, considered by many as the father of modern neuroscience, are also on display.</p>
<p>Cutting/Treating explores the history of surgical intervention on a form of human tissue that is uniquely swift to decay and difficult to dissect. A 5000 year-old skull with holes drilled (or trephined) into it illustrates how long humans have been intervening directly in the matter of the brain, and the exhibition takes a long view of tools and methods, from crude trephination kits to bullet locators and complex Setred 3D imaging systems, and looks at the human stories behind the anatomy (the separation of parts by cutting) of brains. Arresting portraits of patients under the care of Dr Harvey Cushing and his pioneering surgical techniques at the turn of the last century sit beside the work of artist Corrine Day, which records her as she prepares to undergo brain surgery in 1996, while engravings of earlier patients undergoing treatment offer a grim reminder of the realities of a pre-anaesthetic age.</p>
<p>Since the 18th century, preservation techniques have enabled the collection of specimens - including the brains of famous or notorious individuals, which have been intricately studied in the search for the material basis of genius, depravity and human variation. Giving/Taking traces the stories of brain harvesting and the variety of its purpose, from the horrors of Nazi mass murder and experimentation to the hope offered by research into neurodegenerative disorders by today's brain banks. Newly commissioned photography and film of key brain archives and the process of dissection (together with wet samples, artefacts and moving portraits of brain donors by Ania Dabrowska), offer a behind-the-scenes view of the brain's life after death.</p>
<p>The brain contains 100 billion nerve cells and some 100 trillion synapses or neural connections it cannot be transplanted. Brains takes a journey around the spectacular form, structure and condensed volume of our most revered organ, and examines the ambiguous emotions and ethical difficulties associated with the manipulation and dissection of the delicate substance of consciousness.</p>
<p>Marius Kwint, Guest Curator, says: ""Brains shows how a single, fragile organ has become the object of modern society's most profound hopes, fears and beliefs, and some of its most extreme practices and advanced technologies. The different ways in which we have treated and represented real, physical brains open up a lot of questions about our collective minds.""</p>
<p>Ken Arnold, Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection, says: ""We all recognise its outline and know that it is the most important part of us, but for many, the brain remains as mysterious as it is beguiling. This exhibition presents brains of extraordinary people among other intriguing specimens and showcases remarkable tales from more than 500 years of scientific investigation into the physical matter of the mind.&rdquo</p>
<p>Brains: The mind as matter runs from 29 March to 17 June 2012 at Wellcome Collection, 183 Euston Road, NW1 2BE, UK.</p>
<p>A wide programme of events accompanies the exhibition, along with a fully illustrated book, 'Brains: The mind as matter' by Marius Kwint and Richard Wingate.</p>

<p><a href=""/node/1706"">Miracles & Charms</a>, Wellcome Collection's autumn exhibition programme, explores the extraordinary in the everyday with two shows: <a href=""/whats-on/exhibitions/infinitas-gracias"">'Infinitas Gracias: Mexican miracle paintings'</a>, the first major display of Mexican votive paintings outside Mexico and <a href=""/whats-on/exhibitions/charmed-life"">'Charmed life: The solace of objects'</a>, an exhibition of unseen London amulets from Henry Wellcome's collection, curated by the artist Felicity Powell. Drawing lines between faith, mortality and healing, Miracles & Charms offers a poignant insight into the tribulations of daily life and human responses to chance and suffering.</p>
<h2><strong>Infinitas Gracias: Mexican miracle paintings</strong></h2>
<p>Mexican votives are small paintings, usually executed on tin roof tiles or small plaques, depicting the moment of personal humility when an individual asks a saint for help and is delivered from disaster and sometimes death. Infinitas Gracias features over 100 votive paintings drawn from five collections held by museums in and around Mexico City and two sanctuaries located in mining communities in the Bajío region to the north: the city of Guanajuato and the distant mountain town of Real de Catorce. Together with images, news reports, photographs, devotional artefacts, film and interviews, the exhibition illustrates the depth of the votive tradition in Mexico.</p>
<p>Usually commissioned from local artists by the petitioner, votive paintings tell immediate and intensely personal stories, from domestic dramas to revolutionary violence, through which a markedly human history of communities and their culture can be read. Votives displayed in 'Infinitas Gracias' date from the 18th century to the present day. Over this period, thousands of small paintings came to line the walls of Mexican churches as gestures of thanksgiving, replacing powerful doctrine-driven images of the saints with personal and direct pleas for help. The votives are intimate records of the tumultuous dramas of everyday life: lightning strikes, gun fights, motor accidents, ill health and false imprisonment in which saintly intervention was believed to have led to survival and reprieve.</p>
<p>'Infinitas Gracias' explores the reaction of individuals at the moment of crisis in which their strength of faith comes into play. The profound influence of these vernacular paintings, and the artists and individuals who painted them, can be seen in the work of such figures as Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, who were avid collectors. The contemporary legacy of the votive ritual is present in the exhibition through a wall covered with modern-day offerings from one church in Guanajuato: a paper shower of letters, certificates, photographs, clothing and flowers, through which the tradition of votive offering continues today. The sanctuaries at Guanajuato and Real de Catorce remain centres of annual pilgrimage, attracting thousands of people to thank and celebrate their chosen saints.</p>
<h2><strong>Felicity Powell - Charmed Life: The solace of objects</strong></h2>
<p>A 'please' to the votives' 'thank you', 'Charmed Life', curated by Felicity Powell, features some four hundred amulets from Henry Wellcome's vast collection, be exhibited encircled with works - including new pieces and videos - by the artist. The amulets, ranging from simple coins to meticulously carved shells, dead animals to elaborately fashioned notes, are from a collection within a collection, amassed by the banker and obsessive folklorist Edward Lovett, who scoured London by night, buying curious objects from the city's mudlarks, barrow men and sailors, which he sold on to Wellcome.</p>
<p>The amulets are objects of solace. Intended to be held, touched, and kept close to the body, they are by turns designed and found, peculiar and familiar. The potency of the charms is invested through rituals of hope and habit. Each amulet on display has long been separated from its wearer, but collectively they form a repository for the anxieties, reassurances and superstitions of the city and its occupants. Lovett's amulets are held at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, where they have remained archived and largely unseen. The amulets selected by Powell are uncanny: they are secrets brought to light.</p>
<p>Powell's own works address the strange allure of objects which are a source of comfort and compensation. Intricate miniatures, with white wax reliefs on black mirror slate, they carry the same intimacy of size as the amulets, and are meticulously crafted. Her portraits, which appear as inverted silhouettes, white on black, are all in a process of change, metamorphosing into other selves and creatures. Like Lovett's amulets, they seem to be more than themselves, hinting at a hidden magic at work, as they dip between real and imagined worlds. Using the reverse side of a mirror, Powell hides away literal reflection but leaves the viewer wondering at their playful and compelling strangeness.</p>
<p>Film works projected in the gallery see the wax reliefs in animation, featuring the hands of the artist as she works, alongside medical scans of her body overlaid with drawn images of amulets from the Lovett collection. These films, with music by William Basinski, create imagery and forms that relate directly to the objects on display and to the artist's own desire for wellbeing.</p>
<p>Ken Arnold, Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection, says: ""These two exhibitions explore rich traditions of everyday faith and health, presenting us with objects from across cultures, all invested with extraordinary personal potency. Sometimes comforting, other times strange, both simply made and exquisitely wrought: these exhibits give us insight into centuries of charmed lives and miraculous events.""</p>

"825","/press/dirt-filthy-reality-everyday-life","Dirt: The filthy reality of everyday life","<p><strong>24 March - 31 August 2011</strong></p>
<p>Wellcome Collection's major new exhibition takes a closer look at something which surrounds us, but we are often reluctant to confront. Dirt: the Filthy Reality of Everyday Life travels across centuries and continents to explore our ambivalent relationship with dirt. Bringing together around 200 artefacts spanning visual art, documentary photography, cultural ephemera, scientific artefacts, film and literature, the exhibition uncovers a rich history of disgust and delight in the grimy truths and dirty secrets of our past, and points to the uncertain future of filth, which poses a significant risk to our health but is also vital to our existence.</p>
<p>Following anthropologist Mary Douglas' observation that dirt is 'matter out of place', the exhibition introduces six very different places as a starting point for exploring attitudes towards dirt and cleanliness: a home in seventeenth century Delft in Holland a street in Victorian London a hospital in Glasgow in the 1860s a museum in Dresden in the early twentieth century a community in present day New Delhi and a New York landfill site in 2030. Highlights from Dirt include paintings by Pieter de Hooch, the earliest sketches of bacteria, John Snow's ""ghost map"" of cholera, beautifully crafted delftware, Joseph Lister's scientific paraphernalia, and a wide range of contemporary art, from Igor Eskinja's dust carpet, Susan Collis bejewelled broom and James Croak's dirt window, to video pieces by Bruce Nauman and Mierle Ukeles and a specially commissioned work by Serena Korda.</p>
<p>Dirt looks through the lens of Delft scientist Anthony van Leewenhoek's early microscope, to reveal what he described as the ""little animals"" of the microbial world, and explores the widely celebrated and satirised 17th century Dutch obsession with cleanliness. Picking a path through the crowded Victorian slums and pest houses of Soho, the show takes in John Snow's work on cholera and the development of public sanitation in London, and the voices of the mudlarks, ragpickers and dustmen and women whose meagre living depended on the dirt and detritus of the city. The exhibition traces the complicated network of cultural meanings that attached to new discoveries about dirt.</p>
<p>When Joseph Lister arrived at Glasgow Royal Infirmary 1860, patients presenting broken limbs faced a 90% probability of amputation such were the levels of infection. His regime of cleanliness transformed the hospital and marked the birth of antiseptic surgery. But the widespread mantra of hygiene took a darker turn in Dresden, where the Deutsches Hygiene-Museum, founded after the International Hygiene Exhibition in 1911, was co-opted into the ideological horrors of racial purity and ethnic cleansing by the Nazis. From modernity's dogma to corrosive metaphor, the exhibition charts both scientific discoveries and tarnished discourses of cleanliness.</p>
<p>Collisions of personal, ethical and environmental responsibility run throughout Dirt. The meeting of figurative and literal dirt finds a focus in present day New Dehli, where survival by manual scavenging, the clearing of human waste, persists and is most often associated with the Dalits, the people formerly known as 'untouchables'. Facing a social stigmatism perpetuated by the cultural projections of pollution, the plight of manual scavengers is explored through the work of charity Sulabh International and the extraordinary faecal sculptures of Santiago Sierra. The eternal issue of waste disposal is taken up again as Dirt looks to the future, with the 30 year project to transform New York's Fresh Kills, once the largest landfill in the world - a colossal beacon to our everyday waste visible from space - into a public park.</p>
<p>We live in unmistakeably filthy times. For the first time in human history over half the world's inhabitants live in urban environments and exposure to dirt is the corollary of overcrowding, inadequate sanitation and the industrial shaping of metropolitan life. Meanwhile scientists are debating whether our increasing obsession with cleanliness is stripping away our ability to combat infection. However we may wish to sweep it under the carpet or wash our hands of it, this is a subject that continues to make its mark. Dirt will reveal the fascinating world of filth that remains one of the very last taboos.</p>
<p>Ken Arnold, Director of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection, says: ""Dirt is everywhere and periodically we get very worried about it. But we have also discovered that we need bits of it and, guiltily, secretly, we are sometimes drawn to it. Dirt is a perfect subject for Wellcome Collection to explore in our eclectic fashion - the good and bad, the art and science, yesterday and today, in London, Glasgow, New York, Dresden, Delft and New Delhi.""</p>
<p>Dirt: the Filthy Reality of Everyday Life is part of the DIRT Season from Wellcome Trust. Look out for online games and events at special dirty locations, including Eden Project, Glastonbury and other Summer festivals.</p>

<p>Ten previously hidden objects, weird, wonderful and beautiful by turn, go on display in First Time Out (6 June - 31 July), a unique collaboration which sees ten museums and galleries each exhibit an artefact from their archives which has never been seen before. But in a twist, ten stories become twenty as artefacts are switched between partnered venues mid-way through the project, with fresh interpretations provided by the new hosts.</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Participants are the Horniman Museum and Gardens, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Natural History Museum, London, the Science Museum and Wellcome Collection who are twinned with the Royal Shakespeare Company, The Lightbox (Woking), Peterborough Museum, Discovery Museum (Newcastle) and Waddesdon Manor, respectively.</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">From an exquisite Rothschild Meissen dish to a macabre bone guillotine carved by prisoners during the Napoleonic wars, the rarest of Darwin's publications to the Fool's bauble prop from a landmark performance of King Lear, the objects are as varied and surprising as the stories they tell. First Time Out brings out treasures from behind the scenes and moves them between London and the regions, giving each a chance to speak to different audiences and find new meanings. For some, this may be the only time they are ever seen by visitors.</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">The objects being displayed are:</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><strong>Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew:</strong> Charles Darwin's rarest work, Letters on Geology, Privately printed Cambridge, 1835, displayed with corresponding original letter</p>
<p><strong>The Lightbox, Woking:</strong> Stone sculpture by Eric Gill, Torso - Woman (1913)</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><strong>Horniman Museum and Gardens:</strong> Ceremonial mask of Dzunukwa or &ldquo Wild woman of the woods&rdquo from the Northwest Coast of Canada (c. 1900) - displayed in collaboration with U'mista Cultural Centre, Alert Bay, British Columbia</p>
<p><strong>Royal Shakespeare Company:</strong> Fool's bauble, a prop for the RSC Production of King Lear (2007) with Sir Ian McKellen as King Lear and Sylvester McCoy as the fool</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><strong>Natural Histoy Museum, London:</strong> Rough-toothed dolphin skull with ink scrimshaw decoration by unknown sailor (mid C19th)</p>
<p><strong>Peterborough Museum:</strong> Model bone guillotine crafted from left over rations by Napoleonic prisoners of war (early C19th)</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><strong>Science Museum:</strong> Set of ten ivory mathematical puzzles in black lacquer box, made in China (C19th)</p>
<p><strong>Discovery Museum, Newcastle:</strong> First light bulb and light switch designs by Joseph Swan and John H. Holmes (1881 and late 1880s)</p>
<p><strong>Wellcome Collection:</strong> Carved cigar holder representing the coronation of King Ludwig II of Bavaria in 1864</p>
<p><strong>Waddesdon Manor:</strong> Oval dish from &ldquo New Dulong&rdquo pattern service used by Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild (late C18th)</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Ken Arnold, Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection says ""First Time Out is a disarmingly simple idea which opens up complicated questions about the millions of intriguing artefacts looked after by museums and galleries behind closed doors. At its heart are ten fascinating objects whose value is held in the different stories we tell about them. The project is generous in spirit, governed by a shared curiosity about what others&rsquo views and interpretations may lend to our own holdings. We hope that visitors, wherever they see the project, and however many pieces they see, will participate in extending this creative exchange before the objects return to their archives.""</p>

<p>	Waddesdon is the most visited historic house among England's National Trust properties. The collections are a reflection of the passions of the Rothschilds who created and have cared for Waddesdon, from Ferdinand de Rothschild, who built the Manor in the late 19th-century to Jacob, the present Lord Rothschild, through whom contemporary collecting has been revived. <a href=""http://www.waddesdon.org.uk/"">www.waddesdon.org.uk/</a></p>

<p>Cumberland Market will be turned into a glorious garden party for this year's Wellcome Collection midsummer picnic. Growing is the theme of the day and there'll be hands-on activities, demonstrations, performances, food and family fun to please curious minds of all ages.</p>
<p>Picknickers will find pedal go-carts and mini golf in the garden, along with magicians, circus performers and puppet shows. There will be a soft play area for the under 5s and giant games to try out. Our wheelbarrow gardens will offer carefully modelled horticultural delights, and green fingered visitors can try their hand at garden inspired crafts including vegetable printing and leaf art. There will be a chance to adopt a plant so part of the picnic garden will find new homes after the event.</p>
<p>No garden party would be complete without afternoon tea, and we'll also be serving up a salad buffet for lunch. As with all the best picnics, there'll be every opportunity to spread out a rug, unpack some sandwiches and relax.</p>
<p>The midsummer picnic, now in its fifth year, is run in partnership with West Euston Time Bank, focussing on their Homework club and Family Activity Programmes. These programmes support local young learners and their families and bring members together to share skills and strengthen their community.</p>
<p>Eleanor Lanyon, Youth and Community Engagement Officer at Wellcome Collection says: ""The midsummer picnic is a wonderful opportunity for the community to get together, and we've been working with our partners at the West Euston Time Bank to make this year's event fun-packed and activity-filled. All are welcome to come along and help make this picnic a garden party to remember.""</p>

<p>28 June<br />
	Late night event, Friday 5 July, 19.00 - 23.00</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Wellcome Collection is getting off on the wrong foot with an all building spectacular celebrating human failures, fallacies and faults. 'Wrong!' brings together scientists, magicians, film-makers and performers for an evening of errors. Leave your right-mindedness at the door and enter a world led astray, where pleasures are irrational and self-deception is smiled upon. We all make mistakes, and 'Wrong!' gives us the right to enjoy them.</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Slapstick and nonsense are on the bill with a carnival of fools and the rare chance to discover your inner idiot in a clowning master class with director John Wright. Share your shame by telling us your worst mistakes, and hear others' in our error confessional. Close up magicians will be in the building with sleights of minds and hands and psychologist and illusionist Gustav Kuhn will uncover the secrets of how our brains are fooled by their trickery.</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Talks take in neuroscientist Benedetto De Martino on the upsides of irrational thinking, and eyewitness expert Amina Memon explaining how our memory deceives us with the help of an experiment we'll be running during the evening. Neuroscientist Kris de Meyer and film-maker Sheila Marshall will be discussing and screening clips from their upcoming documentary Right Between Your Ears which records the experience of feeling right but being wrong, following people in the USA convinced the world would end on 21 May 2011 and their response to dashed certainty.</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">The Wrongness Cabaret gathers a roll call of comedians, scientists, storytellers and magicians to fawn on failure and delight in disaster, whilst the Wellcome Library will be taken over by games designed to reward creative error in the Wrongness Championships. From the reverse sketching of Anti-Descriptionary to genetic code Chinese whispers, you can challenge friends, try to influence others in making mistakes or be wrong against the clock.</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Around the galleries there will be interactive tests which reveal conviction in the face of confounding evidence, courtesy of Neil Garrett and colleagues from UCL's Affective Brain Lab, disarming perception illusions which make strangers of our brains and bodies, and the Unbelievable Truth of Medical History which challenges us to separate breakthrough from blunder in a quick-fire quiz about disproved cures and theories.</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">A bar will be open (staff will forgive requests for drinks mistaken not stirred) and there'll be nothing to fault with the delicious food served at the Peyton and Byrne cafe. Blackwell's bookshop will provide plenty of material to challenge what you thought you knew to be true. Sometimes discovering you're wrong is just the beginning of a new adventure.</p>
<p class=""MsoPlainText"">Sarah Punshon, curator of 'Wrong!' says: ""I hope visitors to will enjoy the chance to cut loose and enjoy being wrong in the company of brilliant speakers, performers and designers. It's been great fun filling Wellcome Collection with deliberate mistakes and creating an evening that will offer freedom from rightness.""</p>
<p>Ken Arnold, Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection says: ""We all spend much of our lives being mistaken and getting led astray in ways we often try to forget. For one evening, 'Wrong!' side-steps our eagerness to be correct, and instead celebrates our fallibility - finding out a little more about why we&rsquo re so easily and frequently fooled - and suggests that, sometimes, it's right to be wrong.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">'Wrong!' is a free event on Friday 5 July. Drop in any time from 19.00 to 23.00.</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Tickets for talks will be available from Wellcome Collection on the night of the event only.</p>

"883","/press/heart-wellcome-collections-first-major-temporary-exhibition","'The Heart': Wellcome Collection's first major temporary exhibition","<h2><strong>Wellcome Collection’s First Major Temporary Exhibition</strong></h2>
<p>…Leonardo da Vinci Drawings, Andy Warhol Prints, Live Heart Surgery, Sacred Heart Imagery Never Before Seen In Europe, Egyptian Book of the Dead, Foundling Cards, Venous Anatomy Tables…</p>
<p><strong>The Heart book announced; writers include Jonathan Miller</strong></p>
<p>The Heart is the first major temporary exhibition in the new £30m Wellcome Collection. The exhibition explores the medical and cultural significance of the heart featuring exhibits from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Leonardo da Vinci and Andy Warhol, through to live heart surgery.</p>
<p><strong>The Heart: 21 June until 16 September 2007</strong></p>
<p>The Heart brings together contemporary and historic artefacts from across the world to form an exhibition that traces the history of our medical understanding of the heart and examines its extraordinary symbolic and cultural significance. The exhibition follows the development of man’s understanding of the heart: the theories of the Greek surgeon Galen; dissection drawings of the heart by Leonardo da Vinci; mid-17th century anatomical tables from Padua onto which entire human venous and arterial systems have been varnished; the work of William Harvey, the physician who in 1620 published his discoveries of how the heart pumps blood around the body; through to a modern perfusion machine that can take over the function of the heart and lungs during heart surgery; and recent films that deal with the ethical and personal dilemmas faced in the age of heart transplantation.</p>
<p>The powerful cultural symbolism of the heart is illustrated through a range of ancient and contemporary artefacts, such as: the ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead, which shows the heart being weighed against the ‘feather of truth’ in order to determine the deceased’s suitability for the afterlife; Aztec sacrificial knives and an offertory vessel used for offering up the heart of a sacrificial victim to replenish the power of the sun; a rich selection of Christian Sacred Heart imagery, including paintings from Mexico never before seen in Europe and 19th Century heart playing cards cut in half, so that one half could accompany an orphan given up to a Foundling Hospital while the child’s mother retained the other half so that she might be able to reclaim her child in later life.</p>
<p>The Heart also looks at the stories of individuals such as Thomas Hardy and David Livingstone, whose hearts were removed from their bodies after death in order to be buried in a place of particular emotional significance.</p>
<p>Visitors will be able to compare the scale and capacity of the human heart with the hearts of other animals. A 1.75-metre-high sperm whale’s heart is displayed for comparison with those of other animals – from an elephant to a hummingbird. The whale’s heart beats as slowly as 10 times a minute while the hummingbird’s can achieve an extraordinary 1,200 beats a minute when hovering.</p>
<h2><strong>Curatorial team and exhibition design</strong></h2>
<p>Exhibition Curators: Emily Jo Sargent and James Peto</p>
<p>Curatorial Advisors: Louisa Young and Francis Wells</p>
<p>Exhibition Design: Coombe Architecture and Nick Bell Design</p>
<h2><strong>Live Heart Surgery Event, 5 July, 19.00</strong></h2>
<p>The first interactive broadcast of a UK hospital operation to a public audience will take place in support of The Heart exhibition. Heart surgeon Francis Wells and his team at Papworth Hospital will perform a complex reconstruction of a heart valve. The audience at Wellcome Collection will be able to speak to Francis as he operates and handle some of the equipment used in the operation with help from members of the Papworth medical team. The audience will also be able to learn more about the patient and the impact the surgery will have on their life, and why preserving the natural heart valve, rather than replacing it with an artificial valve, allows the heart to function more efficiently.</p>
<h2><strong>The Heart book</strong></h2>
<p>To coincide with this pioneering exhibition, the Wellcome Trust and Yale University Press are publishing The Heart, a richly illustrated 250-page hardback book of nine essays and eight interviews exploring the medical and cultural importance of the heart. Writers include Jonathan Miller, Louisa Young, Francis Wells and Michael Bracewell. The Heart will be available nationwide from May 2007 and sold at Wellcome Collection.</p>
<p><strong>James Peto, Curator, The Heart,</strong> said: “As well as being at the centre of all things anatomical, the heart has always been key to the question of the relationship between body and soul. Today, forty years after the first heart transplant, our understanding of where human character, and indeed life itself, is located has shifted firmly from the heart to the brain. Yet we remain reluctant to let go of the belief that the role of the heart is somehow of much greater significance than that of a biomechanical pump. Drawing on material from everyday life and from the history of art as much as the history of science, the exhibition is an opportunity to try to understand the heart's anatomical and its symbolic power.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Wellcome Collection, the new £30 million visitor attraction from the Wellcome Trust, was opened today by Nobel Prize winner Professor James Watson,co-discoverer of the structure of DNA and Stephen Fry at an evening gala reception.</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection opens to the public on June 21. Admission is free.</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection is a world first. It combines three contemporary galleries together with the world-famous Wellcome Library, public events forum, café, bookshop, conference centre and members’ club, to provide visitors with radical insight into the human condition.</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection builds on the vision, legacy and personal collection of Wellcome Trust founder Sir Henry Wellcome, and is part of the Trust’s mission to foster understanding and promote research to improve human and animal health.</p>
<p>The nine-storey building houses more than 1,300 exhibits across three galleries. Bringing together the worlds of art, science and history they range from the bizarre to the beautiful, the ancient to the futuristic. Examples include work by artists such as Antony Gormley, Leonardo da Vinci, Andy Warhol, Marc Quinn, John Isaacs, Christine Borland and Martin Parr, as well as Aztec sacrificial knives, 19thcentury sex aids, amputation saws, Nelson’s razor and a DNA-sequencing robot.</p>
<p>The galleries Medicine Man, Medicine Now and ‘special exhibitions’ space display exhibits in contemporary ways to challenge and inspire visitors to contemplate issues of human wellbeing, health and identity through the ages. The opening special exhibition is The Heart.</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection is the transformation of the Wellcome Building, the former headquarters of the Wellcome Trust, at 183 Euston Road, built in 1932 to the specification of Sir Henry Solomon Wellcome (1853–1936).</p>
<p>Wellcome was a pharmacist, entrepreneur, philanthropist and collector. His passionate interest in medicine and its history, as well as ethnography and archaeology, led him to gather more than one million objects from across the world. His original vision was to create a ‘Museum of Man’ at 183 Euston Road to display his collection. Wellcome Collection builds on his vision and provides contemporary space to explore human wellbeing through the combination of medicine, life and art.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Wellcome Collection, total size 16 000 m2, is centred around on substantial galleries totalling 1350 m2:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Special exhibitions (650 m2).</strong> The largest gallery in Wellcome Collection will be used to host temporary exhibitions, presenting newly commissioned works and thematic shows structured around topics of medical, cultural and ethical significance. The opening exhibition is:</p>
<ul><li>The Heart (21 June–16 September 2007). An exhibition exploring the medical and cultural significance of the heart, featuring exhibits from Leonardo da Vinci and Andy Warhol, through to the Egyptian Book of the Dead and live heart surgery. The Heart brings together contemporary and historic artefacts from across the world to form an exhibition that traces the history of our medical understanding of the heart and examines its extraordinary symbolic and cultural significance. The exhibition includes a rich selection of Christian Sacred Heart imagery, including paintings from Mexico never seen before in Europe. It also incorporates a wall of animal hearts – from a 1.75 m whale heart to a 2.5 cm ray heart – and shows how recent imaging techniques can reveal the heart’s most intimate workings.</li>
<li>New book: The Heart. To coincide with this pioneering exhibition, the Wellcome Trust and Yale University Press have published The Heart, a richly illustrated 250-page hardback book of nine essays and eight interviews exploring the medical and cultural importance of the heart. Writers include Jonathan Miller, Louisa Young and Michael Bracewell. Full details on The Heart are attached.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Medicine Man (350 m2)</strong></p>
<ul><li>The exhibition contains more than 500 strange and beautiful artefacts from Sir Henry Wellcome’s original collection, presented in a rich American walnutpanelled gallery, centred on a large ‘Wunderkammer’ cabinet. Some exhibits are displayed for their historical significance, e.g. a lock of George III’s hair (found to have traces of arsenic, an 18th-century treatment for madness), while others, such as a brass corset and an iron chastity belt, illustrate our fascination with the body and desire to have control over it. Other objects, such as an early 20th-century infant ID kit and a selection of amulets from the Hildburgh Collection, are presented individually and examined through audio by commentators from different backgrounds, to show that one object can mean many different things and tell many different stories. Full details on Medicine Man are attached.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Medicine Now (350 m2)</strong></p>
<ul><li>Medicine Now explores contemporary medical topics through the eyes of scientists, artists and popular culture in a bright contemporary environment. Art is clearly separated from the scientific exhibits in large red art cubes; galleries inside the gallery. Medicine Now focuses on a few select themes: Genomes, The Body, Malaria, Obesity and The Experience of Medicine. Work by contemporary artists such as John Issacs, Luke Jerram, William Cobbing and Julie Cockburn is displayed.</li>
<li>The first printout of the human genome to be presented as a series of books is included in the exhibition. The 3.4 billion units of DNA code translate into over a hundred volumes, each a thousand pages long, in type so small that it is barely legible.</li>
<li>Two new interactive exhibits have been developed specially for the exhibition. One creates a beautifully rendered ‘Bio-ID’ for each visitor, showing the ways in which biometric data can be collected and used. The other combines a visitor’s face with others in similar demographic groups, to see how, for example, a smoker’s face differs from that of a non-smoker. Full details on Medicine Now are attached.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Satellite exhibits</strong></p>
<ul><li>Artwork and artefacts are located around the building either individually or in themed clusters and provide a ‘fourth gallery’. Works by artists such as Spencer Tunick, Mauro Perucchetti, Anthony Gormley and Marc Quinn are displayed around the building.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h2><strong>Public events</strong></h2>
<p>A lively programme of public events will expand on exhibition themes. Wellcome Collection’s flexible events space, the Forum, will bring audiences face-to-face with prominent experts and personalities from the worlds of art, science and the humanities, to explore current issues and ancient mysteries of human wellbeing. There are ten events from launch until September 2007. Two examples are:</p>
<ul><li>‘Live Surgery’, 5 July, 19.00. The first interactive broadcast of a UK hospital operation to a public audience will take place in support of The Heart exhibition. Heart surgeon Francis Wells and his team at Papworth Hospital will perform a complex reconstruction of a heart valve. The audience at Wellcome Collection will be able to speak to Francis as he operates and handle some of the equipment used in the operation with help from members of the Papworth medical team. The audience will also be able to learn more about the patient and the impact the surgery will have on their life, and why preserving the natural heart valve, rather than replacing it with an artificial valve, allows the heart to function more efficiently.</li>
<li>A Modern Miracle, 26 July, 19.00 – 20.30. A discussion that uncovers the myths and realities of heart transplants. How does one determine death? Why is there an unwillingness to donate livesaving organs? How does it feel to receive someone else’s heart? Join our guests (a surgeon, a psychologist and a transplant recipient) to discuss the myths and realities of heart transplants, possible solutions to the donation crisis and the emotional impact of heart transplants on donor families and recipients.</li>
</ul><p>Information on forthcoming Wellcome Collection events is available <a href=""/events"">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Wellcome Library</strong></h2>
<p>The Wellcome Library contains over two million items and is one of the world’s greatest collections for the study of the history and progress of medicine. The public areas of the Library span two floors and include the fully restored Reading Room, first used as a Hall of Statuary by Sir Henry Wellcome in 1932.</p>
<p>The Library contains 750 000 books, a film and audio collection of 2500 titles, 600 archival collections, 70 000 rare books (published before 1850), and more than 250 000 paintings, prints and photographs. Artefacts range from the Nuremberg< Chronicle (1493), a book depicting the history of the world with 800 woodcut illustrations, to fragments of Books of the Dead from ancient Egypt, to 21st-century born-digital biomedical archives.</p>
<p>The Wellcome Library’s entire collection, laid end to end, would cover a distance of over 18 km – equivalent to 187 times the height of Big Ben.</p>
<p><strong>New for Wellcome Collection, the Wellcome Library has announced:</strong></p>
<ul><li>New book: Cures and Curiosities: Inside the Wellcome Library has been published by Profile Books. The book illustrates the diversity of the Library’s collection with over 150 photographs and personal observations from some of the authors who have used the Library, including Kathryn Hughes, Philip Hoare and Gillian Tindall. The book has been edited by Anthony Gould, with a foreword by Sebastian Faulks.</li>
<li>Uncover: A new touch-screen installation that allows visitors to browse some of the Library’s most prized and interesting holdings. Visitors can create their own exhibition, go on a tour of the collections, and magnify, rotate and find out more about each item.</li>
<li>Wellcome Images: A collection of 200 000 images depicting medical and social history, as well as contemporary healthcare and biomedical science, can be downloaded for use and re-use under a Creative Commons licence for non-commercial use. <a href=""http://images.wellcome.ac.uk."">http://images.wellcome.ac.uk.</a></li>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Dr Mark Walport, Director, the Wellcome Trust,</strong> said: “Health, wellbeing and disease are central concerns to every one of us. Wellcome Collection provides a wonderful opportunity for the Wellcome Trust to entertain, challenge and debate health issues with the public. We will use the extraordinary artefacts collected by Sir Henry Wellcome, augmented by our contemporary collections, extraordinary library and scientific archives to bring to life a wide range of themes relating to health, wellbeing and disease. We invite people to become active participants in Wellcome Collection.”</p>
<p><strong>Clare Matterson, Director, Medicine, Society and History, the Wellcome Trust</strong>, said: “The Wellcome Trust understands the power of using the arts to engage audiences around issues of human health. Since 2002 we have awarded £5.5 million to original and imaginative arts projects inspired by biomedical science. Wellcome Collection combines our experiences with the vision and legacy of Sir Henry Wellcome to provide a contemporary space that enables people to explore the connections between art and medicine in dramatic and challenging ways.”</p>
<p><strong>Professor James Watson</strong> said: 'Where else can you browse the more than 3 billion letters of the human genome, see one of the robots that helped to sequence it and contemplate the reactions of contemporary artists to this major scientific development? In the pioneering Wellcome Collection - how wonderful!'</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Fry</strong>, actor, writer, comedian, filmmaker and co-host of Wellcome Collection’s opening gala on the evening of June 20, with Professor James Watson said: ""One of the most remarkable collections of medical and physiological items ever assembled is united with three intelligent, inspiring and intriguing exhibitions to make as compelling a visit as London has to offer. You'd be sorry to miss it.""</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Wellcome Collection also houses:</strong></h2>
<ul><li>Members’ club. Wellcome Collection’s Club is a place where art meets science and medicine meets anthropology.

</ul><p> </p>
<h2><strong>Past exhibitions </strong></h2>
<p>During the past decade the Wellcome Trust has organised more than 20 exhibitions covering a vast range of biomedical topics, from jellyfish to autism, metamorphosis to pain. In 2003, Medicine Man at the British Museum (a showcase of roughly 700 objects from Sir Henry Wellcome’s original collection) attracted 200 000 visits. Between 2002 and 2005 the Trust presented a series of five major exhibitions at the Science Museum, culminating with Future Face in late 2004, which attracted 120 000 visits. The Trust also hosted numerous exhibitions in its TwoTen Gallery and funded major projects such as the Wellcome Trust Gallery (home to the Living and Dying exhibition) at the British Museum.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Architectural transformation of 183 Euston Road</strong></h2>
<p>Hopkins Architects has remodelled 183 Euston Road to create Wellcome Collection. Sir Henry Wellcome specified that the building should include a sculpture court and majestic galleries. Wellcome Collection reflects his vision and the ideas of education and exploration. The transformed building is a light, modern, airy and contemporary space while also linking back to the original architecture and design. The ground-floor windows have been enlarged to better connect the inside of the building to the outside; passers-by can gaze into the gallery and café areas. The entrance has been modified to allow wheelchair access. Materials used in the building include limestone and maple flooring, marble, maple and American walnut walls, steel and glass. Three galleries span two floors and provide a modern yet largely neutral space to enable the artwork and collections to be presented to best effect. The Wellcome Trust headquarters at 215 Euston Road was also designed by Hopkins Architects and completed in 2004.</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection forms an integral part of a new cultural quarter emerging in north London around Euston and King’s Cross. Wellcome Collection is close to UCL, Birkbeck College, SOAS, the British Library and the British Museum. The redevelopment of King’s Cross and the arrival of the Eurostar provide an exciting new commuter, commercial and creative hub.</p>

	Nigel Richardson, Daily Telegraph</p>
<p>London's latest cultural venue, Wellcome Collection, today announces that it has attracted over 300 000 visits since launching, in time for celebrating its first birthday on 21 June.</p>
<p>Clare Matterson, Wellcome Trust Director for Medicine, Society and History, commented: ""When we embarked on this project, we did wonder 'will anyone come?'. 12 months in and with visitor numbers being what we they are, we are extremely thankful to all who have stopped in on our premises on Euston Road. We won't become complacent for the next year, as we must continually reinvent our programming to make it fresh, relevant and appealing.""</p>
<p>The new venue, which is a cross between an art gallery and science museum, is run by the UK's largest charity, the Wellcome Trust. Wellcome Collection was one of only four venues shortlisted for this year's prestigious Art Fund Prize, a national award given to a public venue whose project demonstrates the most originality, imagination and excellence.</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection's lively programme of challenging exhibitions and events - ranging from 'The Heart' and 'Sleeping & Dreaming' exhibitions to the portrait photography of 'Life Before Death', through to debates, performances and late-night events on topics as broad as organ donation, live open-heart surgery, obesity, chronic fatigue syndrome and stem cell research - have captured the imagination of many and met with wide-reaching critical attention from national and international media.</p>
<p>The £30 million visitor attraction was opened by Stephen Fry in June 2007. Wellcome Collection is a world first. It combines three contemporary galleries together with the world-famous Wellcome Library, a public events forum, a café , a bookshop, the Wellcome Collection Conference Centre and a members' club, to provide visitors with radical insights into the human condition and to explore the connections between art and science.</p>
<p>In celebration of Wellcome Collection's first birthday, the building will host a series of events between 11.00 and 16.00 on Saturday 21 June. Highlights include: taster tours, a chance to see the 'From Atoms to Patterns' exhibition, origami workshops, Gandini Juggling, music from DiscQuartet, film highlights from our first year, raffle tickets and an hourly draw. The event is free and open to the public to drop in at any time as part of the summer season of events.</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection's exhibitions and events programme will continue to intrigue and entertain over the coming months. From 23 July, 26 skeletons from the Museum of London's vast collection of 17 000 will go on display in 'Skeletons: London's buried bones', an exhibition that uncovers 2000 years of the city's history. 'From Atoms to Patterns: Crystal structure designs from the 1951 Festival of Britain' will continue until 10 August.</p>
<p>'War & Medicine' is the third major special exhibition at Wellcome Collection and, following 'Sleeping & Dreaming', the second devised in collaboration with the Deutsches Hygiene-Museum, Dresden. Running between 21 November 2008 and 15 February 2009, the exhibition will assess the impact and influence that warfare and medicine have had on one another. It looks at the way humanity's desire to repair and heal has tried to keep pace with its capacity to maim and kill, meeting sometimes with success and at other times with failure.</p>

<p>DNA is the ""molecule of life"" and has itself gone through many life stages. It has been a natural object, a scientific object and a cultural object. In recent years, it has become re-objectified as a building tool, such as in a bio-computer or a nano-brick.</p>
<p>Professor Nathaniel Comfort reports from the front lines of research and examines how we have historicised and mythologised DNA in order to understand it, and how this process ironically removes DNA from our concept of what makes us human.</p>

"858","/press/%E2%80%98-institute-sexology%E2%80%99-opens-its-doors-wellcome-collection","‘The Institute of Sexology’ opens its doors at Wellcome Collection.","<p>20 November 2014 – 20 September 2015</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection is exploring the most publicly discussed of private acts with ‘The Institute of Sexology’, the first UK exhibition to bring together the pioneers of the study of sex. From Alfred Kinsey’s complex coded questionnaires to Samoan jewellery to sex machines, the show investigates how the diverse research, methods and collections of sexologists have shaped our ever-evolving attitudes towards sexual behaviour and identity.</p>
<p>Featuring objects spanning art, rare archival material, erotica, film, photography, medical artefacts and ethnography, the exhibition moves between pathologies of perversion and contested ideas of normality as sex is observed, analysed and questioned. This is the first exhibition in a £17.5million expansion of Wellcome Collection and occupies a new gallery dedicated to year-long shows. ‘The Institute of Sexology’ will evolve during its run; new commissions, live events, discussions and performances within the gallery space will animate an exhibition designed around visitor contribution and reflective personal experience. The show will form part of a Sexology Season of activity across the country.</p>
<p>The exhibition follows key sexologists including Sigmund Freud, Marie Stopes, Alfred Kinsey, Wilhelm Reich, Magnus Hirschfeld, Margaret Mead, William Masters and Virginia Johnson and the team behind the present-day National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal). It traces the experiments and studies that lifted taboos in the pursuit of truths about sex and tells the remarkable personal stories of those whose questions made it a legitimate field for discussion and study. The show features works exploring sexual identity by artists including Zanele Muholi, John Stezaker, Sharon Hayes and Timothy Archibald. A new commission by Neil Bartlett will revisit the sex survey, celebrating and joining visitors with the hundreds of thousands of anonymous participants whose personal accounts underpin the study of sex.</p>
<p>‘The Institute of Sexology’ is framed by named sites of research from labs to living rooms. The sexologists in the show are all, at heart, collectors, whether of books, testimonies, erotica, photographs or statistics. The first section, ‘The Library’, highlights the systematic archiving and accumulation central to the their craft, including objects from Henry Wellcome’s vast collection of erotica. Opening with the Nazi burning of archives amassed by Magnus Hirschfeld’s Institut für Sexualwissenschaft in Berlin, ‘The Library’ explores how Hirschfeld’s material on homosexuality, along with the library of sexual histories compiled by Havelock Ellis and the forensic legal cataloguing of sexual pathologies by Richard von Krafft-Ebing were assembled squarely against prevailing social codes.</p>
<p>‘The Consulting Room’ brings together unlikely bedfellows in Sigmund Freud and Marie Stopes who despite marked differences of approach and interest (Stopes warned of the harmful “filthiness of psychoanalysis” whilst campaigning for birth control and women’s sexual rights) placed sex at the centre of their attempts to alleviate suffering and, through couch and clinic respectively, offered an intimate space of encounter which counselled sexual satisfaction as a key to human happiness. In Freud’s psychoanalytic practice and Stopes’ candid advice, the exhibition finds very different and influential paths towards freedom of sexual expression.</p>
<p>The work of Bronislaw Malinowski and Margaret Mead amongst Trobiand and Samoan peoples offered a striking and controversial corrective to the Victorian armchair anthropology which characterised these communities as primitive savages living in thrall to an impulsive nature. A section called ‘The Tent’ explores the wide influence of Malinowski and Mead’s conviction that the permissive sexual codes they encountered were an antidote to the deep-rooted anxieties attending sex in Western culture and served to highlight its repression of sex as a culturally determined experience.</p>
<p>‘The Classroom’ investigates Alfred Kinsey’s journey from entomologist exploring the infinite individuality of gall wasps to obsessive compiler of sexual histories – some 18,000 by his death in 1956. With extensive material from the Kinsey archive, the exhibition traces his revelation of sexual variety in mainstream post-war America, his lionising of data and empirical research and the explosive impact of his conclusions of sexual malleability at a time when sex was a barely mentionable subject.</p>
<p>Whilst Kinsey’s work was enabled by his status as a conservative family man, Wilhelm Reich’s message of radical sexual liberation attracted enemies and acolytes in equal measure. ‘The Box’ looks at a hero of counter-culture America and enemy of the state, hailed by the beat poets and pursued by the FDA, and includes an ‘orgone accumulator’ – the reflectively lined box Reich believed generated vital libidinous energy in those who sat inside it.</p>
<p>‘The Lab’ points to the bespoke laboratory William Masters and Virginia Johnson secretly established at Washington University to observe and record hundreds of individuals having sex. Their measurements of real time physiology – heart rate, lubrication, blood pressure, brain activity, organ size - during stimulation and orgasm, established the complexity and power of sexual experience, especially amongst women, and the exhibition explores how their findings and campaigns for gendered equality in climactic response fed into the zeitgeist of the 60’s sexual revolution.</p>
<p>The National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal) took the study of sex into the home. Catalysed by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the first survey, in 1990, sought to enable a sexual health strategy by understanding the sexual behaviour and beliefs of the population through in-home interviews. Two decades and three surveys on, Natsal gives unrivalled statistical insights into the changing attitudes and sexual experiences of the UK population. ‘The Home’ scrutinises the developing methodologies and techniques of contemporary sexologists, alongside the results of the Natsal surveys and casts light on their own personal beliefs and motivations for research.</p>
<p>Honor Beddard, co-curator, says “‘The Institute of Sexology’ presents the study of sex in all its complexity and contradiction. It brings together the diverse collections of data, art, testimony and objects of those who challenged preconceived ideas about sex and tells the human stories behind the charting of sexual experience. Highlighting the profound effect that gathering and analysing information can have in changing attitudes about the human condition, the exhibition reveals our understanding of sexual identity as an ever-evolving story.”</p>
<p>Ken Arnold, Head of Public Programmes at Wellcome Collection, says: “This exhibition is the first of our longer form shows that provide an opportunity to evolve our exploration of a wide-ranging subject over more time and in greater depth than is usual for museums and galleries. In this, and future projects presented in the same gallery, we will experiment with the idea of carrying on curating an exhibition after it has been launched, making live interventions through performance and events, and learning from being open to the public. We hope that ‘The Institute of Sexology’ will become a living repository for visitors’ stories, inspiring debate and self-reflection on this most fascinating and vital of topics.”</p>
<p>‘The Institute of Sexology’ runs from 20 November 2014 to 20 September 2015 at Wellcome Collection, 183 Euston Road, NW1 2BE. It is part of the Sexology Season from Wellcome Collection, which includes digital commissions and events within the exhibition and at partner venues and festivals across the country.</p>
<p>A fully illustrated hardback book will accompany the exhibition featuring essays from thinkers on sex, art and science: Christopher Turner, Alyce Mahon, Shereen El Feki, Katherine Angel, John Bancroft and Cynthia Graham, as well as more than 200 colour images. RRP £24.99. ISBN 978-0-9570285-6-2</p>
<p>The exhibition is designed by Casper Mueller Kneer Architects with graphic design by John Morgan Studio.</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection is creating new galleries and spaces to meet overwhelming demand. Stirling Prize winning architects Wilkinson Eyre are transforming the venue, bringing new areas into public use and linking layers of activity with a dramatic new spiral staircase and interconnected galleries. Alongside our year-long exhibitions, there will be a continued programme of temporary shows, a transformation of the Reading Room into an innovative public space, expanded facilities in the Wellcome Library, a dedicated youth Studio, a new restaurant, Wellcome Kitchen, and an interdisciplinary research space, the Hub at Wellcome Collection.</p>

<p>Wellcome Collection | 15 May to 3 August 2014</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection's foyer and café will be home to small miracles of nature with a newly commissioned intervention of artworks, sculptures and plant propagation by the artist John Newling. 'The Generosity Plates' is an installation that finds inspiration in the extraordinarily adaptable moringa oleifera tree for an exploration of sustenance, storytelling and ecological sustainability.</p>
<p>The moringa tree is often called the miracle tree or famine tree, such is its nutritional richness. Native to the Himalayan foothills of north-western India, and grown across Africa and South America, its hardiness and late flowering, at the end of the dry season, make it an invaluable and dependable food source. Newling's work takes this most generous of plants and finds fresh forms for it, layering new meaning to the myths and legends that surround its dietetic and healing properties.</p>
<p>'The Generosity Plates' follows a cycle, with framed works using pressed moringa plants grown in a previous exhibition, gilded bracelets laser-cut from scans of the trees and a hydroponic unit growing plants for future works. Newling has also designed plates that will enter the service in the Wellcome Café , completing a project begun in a public place of art in a public place of eating. The narrative of growth and decline, with pressed plants held in frames and new shoots being incubated, is provisional, as new artistic forms are envisaged beyond the walls and duration of this display.</p>
<p>Drawing on the Land Art and Arte Povera movements of the 1960s, Newling is as interested in the concepts, process and siting of material as its aesthetic qualities. 'The Generosity Plates' is a work of counterpoints and unlikely alignments. The delicate beauty of golden sculptures play against the moringa plant's resilience, just as tropics-native trees find an unlikely home in the traffic-clogged urbanism of the Euston Road where Wellcome Collection is based. The installation presents an intriguingly modulated vision of nature, working with a plant outside of its natural environment as a means of affirming its rich environmental promise.</p>
<p>John Newling says: ""Wellcome Collection is a good place for this phase of the Moringa Oleifera work. The investigations and exchanges between the tree and me have brought about many material transformations. The trees have been generous in these exchanges and I have learned much from them. My hope is that Wellcome visitors will also experience some of this generosity.""</p>
<p>Following the display the gilded bracelets, whose whorled forms offer a charm-like memorialisation of the moringa, will provide a further nutritional exchange. In a completion of the circle of sustainability, they will be auctioned with proceeds used to buy food for food banks in Nottingham and Penzance where the trees that inform the bracelets were grown as part of Newling's 'Ecologies of Value' exhibition in 2013.</p>
<p>	'The Generosity Plates' runs at Wellcome Collection between 15 May and 3 August 2014.</p>

<p>The first residents of the Hub at Wellcome Collection, a flagship new space for interdisciplinary projects around health and wellbeing, will investigate the busyness of modern life. Bringing together a rich network of scientists, artists, humanists, clinicians, public health experts, broadcasters and public engagement professionals, the group will explore states of rest and noise, tumult and stillness, and the health implications for lives increasingly lived in a hubbub of activity. They have been awarded £ 1million to develop the project over two years.</p>
<p>The group is led by social scientist Felicity Callard (Durham University) with core contributing members comprising psychologist and writer Charles Fernyhough (Durham University), broadcaster Claudia Hammond (BBC's All in the Mind and Health Check), neuroscientist Daniel Margulies (Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences) and poet James Wilkes (University of East Anglia). The group will start their occupancy at Wellcome Collection in October 2014, as the venue opens new spaces and galleries after a £ 17.5m development.</p>
<p>The urge to be busy defines modern life. Rest can seem hard to find, whether in relation to an exhausted body, a racing mind or a hectic city. Should we slow down, or should we embrace intense activity? What effects do each of these states have on the health of our bodies and minds? Such questions frequently find their way into media reports and everyday conversations, but there has never been any sustained interdisciplinary attempt to answer them. The Hub will gather international experts investigating hubbub and rest at different scales, to breathe new life into the questions we ask about rest and busyness.</p>
<p>The ambitious project will be nourished by the research resources of Wellcome Collection, the Wellcome Library and the Wellcome Trust and will embrace the noisy city beyond and the people who live in it. The group, selected from 55 applications, will have freedom to develop ideas and outputs over their residency.</p>
<p>The Hub space at Wellcome Collection will provide a base for the group to perform rigorous, creative research and to stage scientific and artistic experiments, data-gathering and public events. While neuroscientists study the 'resting' brain and mind, artists will explore the borders between signal, sound and noise, psychologists will track people&rsquo s bodily activity, and social scientists will map the city's noise and silences.</p>
<p>Felicity Callard says: ""Our team is enormously excited to take up the first residency of the Hub, and to work with this extraordinary physical and conceptual space to showcase what can be achieved through experimental interdisciplinary endeavours. Our collaborative work on rest and noise will have members of the public at its heart and will create new possibilities for people from all backgrounds to find their own kinds of rest in the busy city. Through our research activities and creative adventures we want to transform how rest and its opposites are understood - and give us all an urgently needed intimacy with a hidden but vital part of our lives"".</p>
<p>Clare Matterson, Director of Medical Humanities and Engagement at the Wellcome Trust says: ""In a field of exceptional applications, Felicity Callard and her team inspired us with a topic of rich potential and pressing concern. The pressures and health implications of unrelenting activity are an inescapable but underexplored part of the environment of modern life. We look forward to the process and outputs of their collaborative curiosity and anticipate their work leaving rich a legacy for academic and creative inquiry, clinical practice and public policy and for the Hub's future as a crucible for innovative interdisciplinary research.""</p>

"853","/press/thinking-body-mind-and-movement-work-wayne-mcgregor-random-dance","Thinking with the body: mind and movement in the work of Wayne McGregor | Random Dance","<p> </p>
<p>Wellcome Collection | 19 September - 27 October 2013</p>
<p>Wayne McGregor is well known for his physically testing choreography and ground-breaking collaborations across dance, film, music, visual art, technology and science. Wellcome Collection's autumn exhibition 'Thinking with the body' explores a series of long-standing interdisciplinary projects organised by his company Wayne McGregor | Random Dance to investigate creativity in dance. Featuring video, photography, multimedia installation, commissioned film and artworks, it is an immersive encounter with the practice of a visionary innovator, developed in the run up to the first performances of his company's new work 'Atomos' at Sadler's Wells.</p>
<p>In 2000, Wayne McGregor l Random Dance embarked on collaborations with artists and researchers from other fields including cognitive and social science, seeking new understanding of choreographic practice and thinking. Initial projects focused on developing software tools to support the creative process in the rehearsal studio, and studying the relationship between mind and movement. In 2008, these evolving projects converged under the heading R-Research, bringing together a group of individuals with a shared passion and curiosity for what might be discovered at the intersections between dance, technology and science. 'Thinking with the Body' explores this shared enquiry into dance-making, bringing alive the tools, methods, analysis and results it has produced.</p>
<p>The exhibition opens with an outline of the dizzying range of artistic partners and diverse influences, engagements and interests of Wayne McGregor | Random Dance, including artist Mark Wallinger, composer John Taverner and designers rAndom International. A timeline and schematic mapping, based on collaborative work with theoretical cognitive psychologist Phil Barnard and designed by Kevin Mount, will trace the evolution of ideas and concepts informing the creation of McGregor's dances. Visitors will encounter one-on-one exercises, developed with Barnard, called Choreographic Thinking Tools. Designed to enhance the creation of new and original dance movement through techniques of guided imagination, playful interactions within the gallery will allow visitors to follow twelve choreographic thinking principles, discovering the complex relationship between the imagination and the making of movement.</p>
<p>A layered mass of projected images and footage will showcase the research processes of cognitive scientist David Kirsh, exploring the patterns of behavior and modes of communication occurring continuously between choreographer and dancers working together in the rehearsal studio. The installation, compiled by Kirsh and film-maker David Bickerstaff, combines interview and rehearsal documentation, providing a fascinating account of Kirsh's work on distributed cognition with the company: the interplay of memory, knowledge and environment that underwrites dancers' physical grammar of gestures, including marking and sketching, in the generation of dance phrases and the organization of choreographic structures.</p>
<p>McGregor has worked for many years on creating choreographic software, combining artificial intelligence and Choreographic Thinking Tools to produce interactive digital objects which inspire and support dance creation in the studio. The latest version of this flexible software, developed for 'Atomos', is called 'Becoming'. Conceived as an additional dancer in rehearsals, it is displayed as a human-scale 3D animation on a large plasma screen. An interdisciplinary team including the anthropologist James Leach and digital artists Marc Downie and Nick Rothwell will feed the software with external stimuli to create a unique digital artwork designed to elicit kinesthetic responses, both for dancers rehearsing 'Atomos' and visitors in the gallery.</p>
<p>'Becoming' will be followed by an immersive sound installation by composer Ben Frost, derived from his mesmerizing score for the Wayne McGregor | Random Dance production FAR (2010). In this empty room attention is directed towards the intense experience of sound and the possibilities, drawn from techniques explored in the exhibition, for transforming aural sensation into new forms of imagery. This absorbing space of imagination leads finally into a room where large-scale film footage taken from the making of 'Atomos' will be playing.</p>
<p>James Peto, Chief Curator at Wellcome Collection says: ""'Thinking with the body' is a study and a celebration of collaborative creativity. The research the exhibition explores is an integral part of Wayne McGregor l Random Dance's experimental practice and it has been fascinating for us to participate in the company's project to make the results more widely accessible. We hope this exhibition offers visitors the opportunity to deepen their understanding of choreographic practice and to contemplate how mind, brain and body interact in each of us.""</p>
<p>Scott deLahunta, Director of R-Research at Wayne McGregor l Random Dance says: ""Our aim has been to enhance and generate new understandings of choreographic practice by bringing the knowledge of dance into conjunction with other fields. Wellcome Collection is expert in organizing innovative exhibitions that show the interaction of ideas from a wide range of domains. Working with them has been a wonderful opportunity to share our collaborative research work, both process and results, with new audiences.""</p>
<p>Thursday evening events accompanying the exhibition will feature discussions with the research collaborators featured in the show and will tackle broader themes including how our brains construct images, the differences between bodies and objects, and how groups work creatively together.

<p><a href=""http://www.randomdance.org/"">Wayne McGregor | Random Dance</a> was founded in 1992 and became the instrument upon which McGregor evolved his fast and articulate choreographic style. With collaboration at the centre of his practice, McGregor has innovated new work with world class artists including composers Scanner, Jon Hopkins and Ben Frost visual artists Mark Wallinger and rAndom International and film-makers Jane and Louise Wilson and Ravi Deepres. Collaboration with science and technology communities has also fuelled choreography mined from radical cognitive research processes. This unique, tenacious questioning between artists and artistic mediums, across the interface of science and art, through the body and mind, has ensured that Wayne McGregor | Random Dance has remained at the forefront of contemporary arts for the past 20 years.</p>
<p>	Wayne McGregor | Random Dance is Resident Company of Sadler's Wells Theatre, London. Wayne McGregor is Resident Choreographer of The Royal Ballet. In January 2011, McGregor was awarded a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) for Services to Dance.</p>

"796","/press/exquisite-bodies-or-curious-and-grotesque-history-anatomical-model","Exquisite Bodies: Or a curious and grotesque history of the anatomical model","<p>A new and intriguing exhibition launching this summer in London will allow visitors to explore a strange and forgotten chapter in medical history. 'Exquisite Bodies' at Wellcome Collection will reveal how spectacular collections of anatomical models were used not only to teach but also to titillate the public in Victorian Britain and Europe.</p>
<p class=""Apple-style-span"">During the 19th century, museums of anatomical models became popular attractions for Europeans seeking an unusual afternoon's entertainment. In London, Paris, Brussels and Barcelona the public could learn about the inner workings of the body through displays that combined serious science with an element of fairground horror.</p>
<p class=""Apple-style-span"">The exhibition will enable visitors to reflect on what these models tell us about Victorian attitudes to anatomical knowledge and issues including sexual reproduction, contagious disease and death. A combination of the beautiful and the grotesque, the examples on show are derived from European collections and museums of the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. They range from superbly accurate specimens designed for private use in teaching in anatomical theatres to models destined for often illiterate audiences in less salubrious parts of town, where displays highlighted the widespread fear of sexually transmitted diseases..</p>

<p>Kate Forde, Curator at Wellcome Collection, explains: ""'Exquisite Bodies' brings together a superb variety of anatomical models, many of which will never have been seen in the UK before. Produced during an era of scientific rationalism, these strange surrogates seem on one hand to illustrate contemporary medicine's interest in empirical knowledge, but at the same time they reveal a range of complex beliefs about life, sex, disease and death.""</p>
<p>By the early 1900s the popularity of these attractions was on the wane. In Britain their contents were labelled obscene and attacked by campaigners intending to expose 'quackery', while in continental Europe they endured for some time longer, often trading on their reputations as freak shows or 'monster parades'. By the eve of World War II many of the collections had been dispersed or destroyed, while some models survived in specialist museums, private collections or as 'end of the pier' entertainments.</p>
<p>'Exquisite Bodies' will feature approximately 50 objects from collections across the UK and Europe.</p>

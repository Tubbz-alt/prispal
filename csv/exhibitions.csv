"3984","/exhibitions/our-provocation","Our Provocation ","<p>Young women from New Horizon Youth Centre have been working with artist Hannah Hull to design a visual campaign. Over eight sessions, the group have explored their ideas and opinions on issues such as mental health, sexual health, role models, body image and nutrition.</p>
<p>The campaign is formed of two sections, one in the windows of the studio and the other on the walls of the corridor. The former contains slogans and statements of protest generated by the group. The other features everyday products with health warnings that have been subverted by the young people, such as alcohol, medication and mobile phones.</p>
<p>During the workshops the young people have been responding to the idea of ‘Provocation’ in Can Graphic Design Save Your Life?, and used the exhibition content to stimulate their ideas. See what they have to say outside the Youth Studio.</p>

"3945","/exhibitions/WduTricAAN7Mt8yY","Ayurvedic Man: Encounters with Indian medicine ","<p>Shedding light on Wellcome’s historical collections that relate to Ayurveda and Indian medicine and tracing how health narratives have been shaped by multiple cultural encounters. </p>
<p>This exhibition takes its title and inspiration from the ‘Ayurvedic Man’ – an 18th-century Nepali painting depicting the organs and vessels of the male body according to classical Ayurveda. Showcasing an exquisite range of material, including Sanskrit, Persian and Tibetan manuscripts, vibrant gouache paintings, erotic manuals and animal-shaped surgical tools from our collections, the exhibition includes a new commission by artist Ranjit Kandalgaonkar reimagining the Bombay plague epidemic of 1896.</p>
<p>Ayurveda has been associated for thousands of years with a range of medical practices rooted in South Asia. Widely practised today in India and beyond, it has been transformed during exchanges with biomedicine and the global market of wellness. As Ayurveda evolves and objects are dispersed across museums, several questions remain: Who owns medical heritage? And what is the contemporary relevance of collections built from colonial encounters? </p>
<p>Ranjit Kandalgaonkar’s commission follows from his <a href=""http://www.gasworks.org.uk/residencies/ranjit-kandalgaonkar-2017-07-03/"">residency at Gasworks</a>, London, which was supported by the Charles Wallace India Trust and Inlaks Shivdasani Foundation.</p>

"3921","/naturalhabitat","Natural Habitat","<p>‘Natural Habitat’ is a new artwork that has been created by Year 9 art students from Central Foundation Boys’ School in collaboration with the artist Verity-Jane Keefe. The piece is the result of an exciting five-month co-production project in which the group have explored ideas that are central to the exhibition ‘A museum of modern nature’ - ideas of what we mean by ‘nature’ and how it relates to their lives.</p>
<p>The installation is on display in ‘A museum of modern nature’, in gallery 2 on level 1 of Wellcome Collection. The piece encourages visitors to step inside the groups’ alternative natural habitat and become living specimens in their modern diorama.</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection’s Youth Programme selected Central Foundation Boys’ School for the project following an application process in September 2016, and appointed Verity-Jane Keefe as the lead artist. Verity-Jane devised and delivered a series of afterschool and day-long workshops which enabled the students to explore the theme of nature through a variety of creative media. Taking the previous Wellcome Collection exhibition, ‘Making Nature’, as a starting point, the workshops passed the baton over to the group to enable them to occupy and explore the theme of what nature actually is to a young person living in the city today. Using sculpture, curating, collage, photography and drawing, the workshops referenced traditions of natural history but also questioned stereotypes of nature. The group also visited Rainham Marshes Nature Reserve.</p>
<p>The final piece explores the complex subject of what nature is and might be in the future, containing familiar architecture found on journeys surrounding the group’s daily journeys, alongside flora, fauna, fragments from the built environment, fried chicken, PlayStation controllers and much more: all things found in the landscape of the everyday. An accompanying soundtrack presents ambient sounds from these journeys alongside dialogue exploring the work and themes. </p>
<p>This project has been organised as part of our Youth Programme, which engages young people (in their school and leisure time) and local communities through participatory projects that build knowledge, inspire creativity and promote confidence. This project is an example of co-production, where we team up experts in a field with young people to create material that can be enjoyed by all who visit our venue.</p>
<p>The young artists from Central Foundation Boys School are: Alex, Charlie, Emmanuel, Evan, George, Gurpreet, Irfan, Isa, Josiah, Leevon, Magnus, Malachi, Muntasar, Percival and Xavier.</p>

<p>Many of us think of nature as something separate to ourselves – something elsewhere, somewhere to visit and not part of our daily lives. Yet in reality nature is all around us. Whether we live in densely packed cities or rural countryside, we are part of a complex ecosystem with the plants, animals, land, air and water that surround us.</p>
<p>Our summer exhibition shines a light on how each of us connects with nature. We are displaying objects borrowed from members of the public that tell a story about their relationship with nature. Together they create a collective snapshot of how we think about nature in the 21st century and explore how the health of our planet is intricately bound up with the behaviours and values of the people who inhabit it.</p>
<p>To represent the many and varied voices of our public a small team of people who work with nature in their daily lives have chosen the objects that go on display in the exhibition. These include a park manager, a shaman, a dairy farmer and a plant scientist. You can find out more about them and their own chosen objects below.</p>
<p>The environmental challenges we face are global but the solutions to them start with the personal and the local. Help us create a different kind of museum of nature – one which celebrates our everyday relationship with the world around us.</p>

<p>Kicking off a year-long exploration into our relationship with nature, this major exhibition examines what we think, feel and value about other species and the consequences this has for the world around us. It brings together over 100 fascinating objects from literature, film, taxidermy and photography to reveal the hierarchies in our view of the natural world and consider how these influence our actions, or inactions, towards the planet.</p>
<p>Organised around four themes – ‘Ordering’, ‘Displaying’, ‘Observing’ and ‘Making’ – this exhibition questions the approach of ‘learning through looking’, charts the changing fashions of museum displays alongside society’s changing attitudes to the world around us, examines the search for an authentic encounter with nature, and looks at how humans have intentionally altered other organisms.</p>

"3543","/electricity","Electricity: The spark of life","<p>The story of electricity is the story of life itself. From the structure of the atom to the functioning of our brains, this invisible yet vital force is intrinsic to human life. For centuries electricity has captivated inventors, scientists and artists alike, and in the modern era it has transformed our world.</p>
<p>From the first breaths of Frankenstein’s monster to the brutal simplicity of the execution chair, this exhibition contemplates the contradictory life-giving and death-dealing extremes generated by electricity, and traces the story of how humanity has striven to understand, unlock and gain control over this invisible yet all-encompassing force, which continues to mystify and amaze.</p>
<p>Three celebrated artists have been commissioned to create three new artworks for this exhibition: John Gerrard has taken inspiration for his commission from Luigi Galvani's famous experiments into bioelectricity; Bill Morrison explores historical footage from the Electricity Council archive to consider the movement and networks of electricity and its profound interconnectedness with our daily lives; and Camille Henrot considers our energy-dependent lifestyles, as well as the relationship between humans, technology and the environment.</p>
<p><strong>One of the commissioned works in 'Electricity' contains strobe effects.</strong> The rest of the exhibition can be visited without entering this installation. Please contact us if you’d like to know more.</p>
<p>'Electricity: The spark of life' is a collaboration between Wellcome Collection (London), the Museum of Science and Industry (Manchester) and Teylers Museum (Haarlem) and will be presented as a touring exhibition at each of these venues, beginning at Wellcome Collection in Spring 2017.</p>

<p>When does your mind wander, and where does it go? Despite their negative reputation, might boredom, mind-wandering and doodling benefit us? Using creative cues to spark your imagination, let your mind roam in Wanderland while you explore, draw, make and do.</p>
<p>This installation has been created and curated by a group of young people from RawMinds, Wellcome Collection’s creative programme for 14-to-19-year-olds, working with artist Joceline Howe.</p>

Reimagine the institution, informed by the experiences of the patients, doctors, artists and reformers who inhabited the asylum or created alternatives to it.</strong></p>
<p>Today asylums have largely been consigned to history but mental illness is more prevalent than ever, as our culture teems with therapeutic possibilities: from prescription medications and clinical treatment to complementary medicines, online support, and spiritual and creative practices. Against this background, the exhibition interrogates the original ideal that the asylum represented – a place of refuge, sanctuary and care – and asks whether and how it could be reclaimed.</p>
<p>Taking Bethlem Royal Hospital as a starting point, ‘Bedlam: the asylum and beyond’ juxtaposes historical material and medical records with individual testimonies and works by artists such as David Beales, Richard Dadd, Dora García, Eva Kotátková, Madlove: A Designer Asylum, Shana Moulton, Erica Scourti, Javier Téllez and Adolf Wölfli, whose works reflect or reimagine the institution, as both a physical and a virtual space.</p>

"3289","/exhibitions/voice-hearing-project","Voice Hearing Project","<p>Seven young voice hearers, aged 14-19, have collaborated with artist Hannah Hull to create a significant body of artwork that comments on a key theme in our current exhibition ‘<a href=""/thisisavoice"">THIS IS A VOICE</a>’.</p>
<p>The main piece created, <strong>Everyday Objects Belonging to a Voice Hearer / Everyday Objects Belonging to a Non Voice Hearer</strong>, 2016 (pictured above) is on display in gallery 1 on level 0 of Wellcome Collection. Featuring in the ‘Unlocated Voices’ section of the exhibition, this artwork aims to evoke and challenge the viewer’s expectations of a voice hearer. It is a site-specific work which plays with how objects considered to have social significance are presented for public consumption. The work appears as a genuine exhibit of everyday objects and engages the viewer in a process of distinguishing between objects belonging to a voice hearer and those belonging to a non voice hearer.</p>
<p>In addition to the main piece, the group have created individual artwork concepts and a series of provocations on display in the Studio windows on level 1, plus a slogan for badges and T-shirts being worn around the exhibition and beyond (see below for details).</p>
<p>The young people came from different parts of London to attend six day-long workshops that creatively explored their thoughts, responses and experiences around voice hearing. The group was recruited by the Voice Collective, part of Mind in Camden (see below).</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection’s Youth Programme appointed Hannah Hull as lead artist on this project. She created and delivered six varied workshops that explored the content of the exhibition and the experiences of the young people. The workshops provided an insight into a range of conceptual art movements - including Dada, Fluxus and Situationist International - to stimulate the creative thinking and direction of the group. Each week Hannah responded to the interests of the group when developing the next session.</p>
<p>Our Youth Programme engages young people (in their school and leisure time) and local communities through participatory projects that build knowledge, inspire creativity and promote confidence. This project is an example of co-production, where we team up experts in their field with young people to create material that can be enjoyed by all who visit our venue.</p>

"2659","/exhibitions/series-long-tables"," A Series of Long Tables","<p>Conceived by Lois Weaver, the ‘Long Table’ is an experimental open public forum that is a hybrid performance, installation, roundtable discussion and dinner party designed to facilitate dialogue by gathering together people with common interests.</p>
<p>This series of Long Tables will focus on <strong>sex in relation to ageing, consent, education and pleasure,</strong> in response to conversations with our visitors at previous events.</p>
<p>The Long Table is a dinner party structured by etiquette, where conversation is the only course. The project ingeniously combines theatricality and models for public engagement. It is at once a stylised appropriation and an open-ended, non-hierarchical format for participation. Both of these elements – theatrical craft and political commitment – are mutually supporting in this widely and internationally toured work. The (often-feminised) domestic realm here becomes a stage for public thought.</p>
<p>The Long Table is inspired by Marleen Gorris’s film Antonia’s Line, in which the protagonist continually extends her dinner table to accommodate a growing community of outsiders and eccentrics until, finally, the table must be moved out of doors. The Long Table, then, brings what might often be seen as ‘outside’ in – to a realm of conviviality – while showing how everyday, domestic things which might usually remain hidden can be brought out – into a realm of public ideas and discourse.</p>

<p><b>Please note: At busy times, there may be queues and timed tickets may be in operation.</b></p>
<p>'Forensics: the anatomy of crime’ explores the history, science and art of forensic medicine. It travels from crime scene to courtroom, across centuries and continents, exploring the specialisms of those involved in the delicate processes of collecting, analysing and presenting medical evidence. It draws out the stories of victims, suspects and investigators of violent crimes, and our enduring cultural fascination with death and detection.</p>
<p>The exhibition contains original evidence, archival material, photographic documentation, film footage, forensic instruments and specimens, and is rich with artworks offering both unsettling and intimate responses to traumatic events. Challenging familiar views of forensic medicine shaped by fictions that came out of the sensational reporting of late Victorian murder cases and popular crime dramas, ‘Forensics’ highlights the complex entwining of law and medicine, and the scientific methods it calls upon and creates.</p>
<p>A wide programme of events will accompany the exhibition and a publication of the same name, by crime writer Val McDermid is available (see below).</p>

"2040","/memorytrace","Memory Trace at the Wellcome Trust","<p>London landmarks take a cerebral twist in Gayle Chong Kwan's 'Memory Trace', a newly commissioned photographic work displayed in the windows of the Wellcome Trust headquarters. Delicately sculpted from historical illustrations of the brain found in the collections of the Wellcome Library, Chong Kwan's landscape presents a sinuously beautiful account of the city. By featuring landmarks used by taxi drivers as navigational points, the artist links the capital&amp;rsquo s urban topography with connections generated by memory.</p>
<p>'Memory Trace' is inspired by the research of Professor Eleanor Maguire of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at UCL, which shows that the process of acquiring 'the Knowledge' - the complex layout of central London's 25 000 streets - causes structural changes in the brains of taxi drivers.</p>
<p>During the day, Chong Kwan's panorama presents the familiar skyline of the buildings and attractions that make up the city, but a closer inspection reveals an intricate collage of historical drawings and paintings: attempts to record and visualise the workings of the brain. At night, LEDs map out the journeys frequently taken by taxis and reflect the creation of new neural pathways. The landscape, photographed from models put together by the artist, carries the life of the city and the physical matter of our apprehension.</p>

"34","/exhibitions/aura-satz-sound-seam","Aura Satz: Sound Seam","<p>Exploring the material qualities of sound and memory is a perpetual theme in the work of Aura Satz.</p>
<p>While artist-in-residence at University College London's <a href=""http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ear/"" title=""Sound Seam"">Ear Institute</a>, 2009-2010, Satz was particularly drawn to the anatomy of hearing along with past and present technological devices designed to enhance hearing through the amplification or reproduction of sound. Here she encountered recordings of otoacoustic emissions (sounds which are generated from within the inner ear), and began to document microscopic imagery of the ear drum, cochlea and inner ear hair cells.</p>
<p>'Sound Seam' was produced during this residency and is inspired by Rainer Maria Rilke's text 'Primal Sound', which considers the possibility of playing the coronal suture of a human skull using a phonograph needle.</p>
<p>Creating an ethereal resonance between sound and vision, 'Sound Seam' begins by enticing the viewer through the mouth of a series of gramophone horns, like a portal into another place and time. The film invokes the idea that every surface, in particular parts of our anatomy, is potentially inscribed with an unheard sound or echo of voices from the past. The process of exposing these hidden sounds is mirrored by the various processes associated with record cutting, record playing, overwriting and erasing technologies, as the seemingly infinite grooves are seen spinning and distorting at high magnification, with a dizzyingly hypnotic effect.</p>
<p>The film's soundtrack combines musical composition interlaced with two voices that each reveal an opposing perspective of the same mournful love story, involving a series of unsuccessful attempts to decode an elusive and inaudible secret. The music is derived from recordings of a gramophone needle tracing the sound of the meandering furrow that joins the two parts of the skull, interspersed with recordings of otoacoustic sounds emitted by the ear. Over 100 of these recordings have been individually cut onto a wax cylinder or disc record, some even over-written in order to create multiple layers and unexpected surface noises, scratches, glitches, loops and echoes.</p>

"33","/exhibitions/dirt-filthy-reality-everyday-life","Dirt: The filthy reality of everyday life","<p>'Dirt' reveals the fascinating world of filth that remains one of the very last taboos.</p>
<p>Our major new exhibition takes a closer look at something that surrounds us but that we are often reluctant to confront. 'Dirt' travels across centuries and continents to explore our ambivalent relationship with dirt.</p>
<p>Bringing together around 200 artefacts spanning visual art, documentary photography, cultural ephemera, scientific artefacts, film and literature, the exhibition uncovers a rich history of disgust and delight in the grimy truths and dirty secrets of our past, and points to the uncertain future of filth, which poses a significant risk to our health but is also vital to our existence.</p>
<p>Following anthropologist Mary Douglas's observation that dirt is 'matter out of place', the exhibition introduces six very different places as a starting point for exploring attitudes towards dirt and cleanliness: a home in 17th-century Delft in Holland, a street in Victorian London, a hospital in Glasgow in the 1860s, a museum in Dresden in the early 20th century, a community in present day New Delhi and a New York landfill site in 2030.</p>
<p>Highlights include paintings by Pieter de Hooch, the earliest sketches of bacteria, John Snow's 'ghost map' of cholera, beautifully crafted delftware, Joseph Lister's scientific paraphernalia and a wide range of contemporary art, from Igor Eskinja's dust carpet, Susan Collis's bejewelled broom and James Croak's dirt window, to video pieces by Bruce Nauman and Mierle Ukeles and a specially commissioned work by Serena Korda.</p>

<p>The 'Skin' exhibition invites you to re-evaluate the largest and probably most overlooked human organ. We consider the changing importance of skin, from anatomical thought in the 16th century through to contemporary artistic exploration.</p>
<p>Covering four themes (Objects, Marks, Impressions and Afterlives), 'Skin' takes a philosophical approach. It begins by looking at the skin as a frontier between the inside and the outside of the body. Early anatomists saw it as having little value and sought to flay it to reveal the workings of the body beneath.</p>
<p>The exhibition then moves to look at the skin as a living document: with tattoos, scars, wrinkles or various pathologies, our skin tells a story of our life so far. Finally, the skin is considered as a sensory organ of touch and as a delicate threshold between life and death.</p>
<p><a href=""/articles/skin-lab"">Skin Lab</a>, which features artistic responses to cutting-edge research and technological developments in skin science from the mid-20th century onwards, will complement the exhibition.</p>

"24","/exhibitions/heart","The Heart","<p>The heart, widely understood as the place where life begins and ends, has always featured as a potent symbol in our religions, myths and rituals. Modern medical science has taught us that much of the power and influence traditionally attributed to the heart actually lies in the brain. Nevertheless we remain reluctant to let go of the notion - deeply rooted in everyday language and imagery - that the heart is the home of our emotions and of our true character.</p>
<p>This exhibition looked at the evolution of our understanding of what the heart is, what it does and what it means. Concentrating primarily on Western medicine and culture, it brought together objects and images from the histories of both science and art, as well as from everyday life.</p>
<p>It followed the development of our anatomical knowledge of the heart, but also considered its far-reaching cultural and symbolic significance. Why is it that the pump that circulates our blood is so intimately bound up with the way we discuss our emotional and moral lives, and so central to the question of the relationship between body and soul?</p>

<p>The exhibition drew together 300 objects across five major themes and a public events programme, to enable visitors to explore the biomedical and neurological processes that take place in the sleeping body, and the social and cultural areas of our lives to which sleep and dreams are linked.</p>
<p>'Sleeping & Dreaming' exhibits ranged from work by artists such as Goya and Rodney Graham to a victim of sleep-deprivation interrogation talking about his experiences, a vehicle designed to provide homeless people with a mobile place to sleep and bizarre alarm clocks (one of which lights a candle to ensure the sleeper gets up).</p>

<p>'Twenty Six Things' is a film by the artist Marion Coutts, commissioned by Wellcome Collection. It is based on a simple memory game in which participants are shown a collection of objects, some of which might change position when they look away. The film is an investigation into the vast museum of artefacts gathered by Henry Wellcome.</p>
<p>'Twenty Six Things' explores common concerns in Marion Coutts's work: the relationship between sculpture and film, and the generation of meaning in visual perception, through effects of repetition, interval and pattern.</p>
<p>Marion Coutts works in sculpture, film and video. Recent exhibitions have included 'To Be Continued...' at Helsinki Kunsthalle, 'Responding to Rome' at The Estorick Collection, The New Art Centre and Chisenhale Gallery. In 2003-04 she held the Kettle's Yard Fellowship at St John's College, Cambridge, and in 2001 the Momart Fellowship at Tate Liverpool. She lives and works in London, lectures at Goldsmiths College and is a research fellow at Norwich School of Art and Design.</p>

"19","/exhibitions/atoms-patterns","From Atoms to Patterns","<p>This exhibition explored the intriguing creations of the Festival Pattern Group - a unique project at the 1951 Festival of Britain involving X-ray crystallographers, designers and manufacturers. At the instigation of Dr Helen Megaw, a leading Cambridge scientist, diagrams of atomic structures inspired an eclectic array of patterns on curtains, wallpapers, carpets, lace, dress fabrics, ties, plates and ashtrays.</p>
<p class=""arrow_purple_box"">X-ray crystallography was one of the most exciting branches of postwar science, with far-reaching applications in chemistry, physics, biology and mineralogy. By studying X-ray diffraction photographs of crystals, scientists could calculate the arrangement of atoms within molecules. The resulting diagrams provided the inspiration for the Festival Pattern Group. 'From Atoms to Patterns' showed the diagrams next to the designs.</p>
<p>Stored away for over 50 years in the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Festival Pattern Group's creations were reunited en masse for the first time since the Festival. Highlighting the intricacy and beauty of crystal structures, these avant-garde designs stand as a testament to the optimism of the early post-war era and the vibrancy of 1950s design.</p>

Excavations required for the continuous redevelopment of London have revealed a city of skeletons hidden beneath our streets. Burial grounds have been uncovered right across the city - sometimes beneath familiar landmarks and at other times in the most banal of locations.</p>
<p class=""arrow_purple_box"">Drawn from the Museum of London's astonishing collection of 17 000 skeletons spanning 16 centuries, this exhibition examined the bones of some of those who lived, died and were buried in our city. The skeletons reflect London's rich past and varied social geography - from the affluent district of Chelsea to the Cross Bones cemetery in Southwark, believed to have been established originally as a graveyard for prostitutes.</p>
<p class=""arrow_purple_box"">Through careful forensic analysis by the team at the Museum of London, each skeleton reveals its own story, allowing us fascinating insights into the times in which they lived and the health hazards of the day - from syphilis to smallpox and rickets.</p>

"16","/exhibitions/madness-modernity","Madness & Modernity","<h2><strong>Mental illness and the visual arts in Vienna 1900</strong></h2>
<p>Vienna at the turn of the 20th century was one of Europe's leading centres for modernism. This was a tumultuous period of transition in which the arts, literature, architecture and philosophy blossomed. A time when Sigmund Freud, among others, pioneered new ideas about the self and psychiatry.</p>
<p>Vienna in 1900 was a city obsessed with the mind. Political unrest had left the Viennese with an overwhelming sense that they were living in 'nervous times'. Anxieties about mental health were allied to fears about the modern city this context helped to foster progress in psychiatric care and innovation.</p>
<p>This multidisciplinary exhibition presented the range of ways madness and art interacted in Vienna, from designs for utopian psychiatric spaces to the drawings of patients confined in them. It explored the influence of psychiatry on early modernism and encouraged us to reflect on how we deal with mental illness 100 years on.</p>

"15","/exhibitions/exquisite-bodies","Exquisite Bodies","<p>In the 19th century, despite the best efforts of body snatchers, the demand from medical schools for fresh cadavers far outstripped the supply. One solution to this gruesome problem came in the form of lifelike wax models. These models often took the form of alluring female figures that could be stripped and split into different sections. Other models were more macabre, showing the body ravaged by 'social diseases' such as venereal disease, tuberculosis and alcohol and drug addiction.</p>
<p class=""arrow_purple_box"">With their capacity to titillate as well as educate, anatomical models became sought-after curiosities, displayed not only in dissecting rooms but also in sideshows and the curiosity cabinets of wealthy Victorian gentlemen. For a small admission fee, visitors seeking an unusual afternoon's entertainment could visit displays of these strange dolls in London, Paris, Brussels and Barcelona.</p>
<p class=""arrow_purple_box"">This exhibition explores the forgotten history of the anatomical model, which with its unique combination of serious science and fairground horror provides a rare insight into 19th-century beliefs about the body.</p>

Many museums and galleries hold rich and varied collections, though often only a fraction of exhibits can be displayed at any one time while the rest lie dormant in mysterious vaults, waiting to be discovered. First Time Out is an initiative that brings new perspectives to museum objects by placing them in different contexts.</p>
<p>In 2011, <a href=""/exhibitions/first-time-out"">five London museums each exchanged carefully selected pieces</a> from their collections that had rarely or never previously been seen by the public and presented them with a range of different interpretations, from the cultural to the scientific.</p>
<p>In 2013, curators from ten museums and galleries across the country have scoured the depths of their collections to reveal a selection of uniquely varied and extraordinary treasures, from the very first light bulb to a model guillotine built from leftover rations by prisoners of war. Each object will be showcased in its original setting before travelling to a partner location to be encountered by different audiences, and surrounded by a completely different set of references.</p>
<p>By shining a spotlight on individual items, First Time Out creates connections between objects, people and locations, whilst exploring the wonders of our national treasure troves.</p>

"36","/whats-on/exhibitions/infinitas-gracias","Infinitas Gracias: Mexican miracle paintings","<p>Mexican votives are small paintings, usually executed on tin roof tiles or small plaques, depicting the moment of personal humility when an individual asks a saint for help and is delivered from disaster and sometimes death. 'Infinitas Gracias' will feature over 100 votive paintings drawn from five collections held by museums in and around Mexico City and two sanctuaries located in mining communities in the Bají o region to the north: the city of Guanajuato and the distant mountain town of Real de Catorce. Together with images, news reports, photographs, devotional artefacts, film and interviews, the exhibition will illustrate the depth of the votive tradition in Mexico.</p>
<p class=""immtextalignleft"">Usually commissioned from local artists by the petitioner, votive paintings tell immediate and intensely personal stories, from domestic dramas to revolutionary violence, through which a markedly human history of communities and their culture can be read. The votives displayed in 'Infinitas Gracias' date from the 18th century to the present day. Over this period, thousands of small paintings came to line the walls of Mexican churches as gestures of thanksgiving, replacing powerful doctrine-driven images of the saints with personal and direct pleas for help. The votives are intimate records of the tumultuous dramas of everyday life - lightning strikes, gunfights, motor accidents, ill-health and false imprisonment - in which saintly intervention was believed to have led to survival and reprieve.</p>
<p class=""immtextalignleft"">'Infinitas Gracias' will explore the reaction of individuals at the moment of crisis in which their strength of faith comes into play. The profound influence of these vernacular paintings, and the artists and individuals who painted them, can be seen in the work of such figures as Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, who were avid collectors. The contemporary legacy of the votive ritual will be present in the exhibition through a wall covered with modern-day offerings from one church in Guanajuato: a paper shower of letters, certificates, photographs, clothing and flowers, through which the tradition of votive offering continues today. The sanctuaries at Guanajuato and Real de Catorce remain centres of annual pilgrimage, attracting thousands of people to thank and celebrate their chosen saints.</p>

"37","/whats-on/exhibitions/charmed-life","Felicity Powell - Charmed Life: The solace of objects","<p>""It seems that the soul... loses itself in itself when shaken and disturbed unless given something to grasp on to and so we must always provide it with an object to butt up against and to act upon."" Michel de Montaigne, 'Essais', 1580</p>
<p>'Charmed Life: The solace of objects' is the result of the artist Felicity Powell's engagement with a collection of 1400 amulets assembled by the Edwardian amateur folklorist Edward Lovett. One of the few people to have had access to this curious collection of 'charms', once carried in the pockets of Londoners for luck or protection, Powell was intrigued by the silent witness they bore to countless personal narratives, most of which are now lost to history. Despite being long divorced from their original owners, these objects, borowed from Oxford University's Pitt Rivers Museum, seemed to retain an insistent sense that they might yet hold some hidden magic.</p>
<p>Amulets have appeared throughout history and across many cultures in an infinite variety of forms. Each has been invested with the hope or belief that it could somehow mediate on behalf of its owner. They are tiny embodiments of the anxieties we feel about our human frailties, their assumed powers often drawing on the dark arts of superstition and magic.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the potency - sometimes alluring, sometimes repellent - of these much-touched objects, Powell found parallels with her own artistic practice. The films and artworks that complement her curation of the amulets show her own fascination with the small and intimate, as well as the accompanying compulsion to create images and objects ""to butt up against and to act upon"" - objects that might themselves, as in Montaigne's description, help to anchor the soul.</p>

Featuring over 200 objects spanning art, rare archival material, erotica, film and photography, this is the first UK exhibition to bring together the pioneers of the study of sex.</p>
<p>From Alfred Kinsey's complex questionnaires to the contemporary National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal), 'The Institute of Sexology' investigates how the practice of sex research has shaped our ever-evolving attitudes towards sexual behaviour and identity. Moving between pathologies of perversion and contested ideas of normality, it shows how sex has been observed, analysed and questioned from the late 19th century to the present day.</p>
<p>'The Institute of Sexology' tells the complex and often contradictory story of the study of sex through its pioneers, including Magnus Hirschfeld, Sigmund Freud, Marie Stopes, Alfred Kinsey, Margaret Mead, William Masters and Virginia Johnson, and the team behind Natsal. It highlights the profound effect that the gathering and analysis of information can have in changing attitudes and lifting taboos.</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">The show features contemporary artworks exploring sexual identity by artists Zanele Muholi, John Stezaker, Sharon Hayes and Timothy Archibald. A new commission by artist Neil Bartlett will revisit the sex survey, joining visitors with the hundreds of thousands of anonymous participants whose personal accounts underpin the study of sex.</p>
<p>This is the first of our longer exhibitions in our newly opened Gallery 2. 'The Institute of Sexology' will evolve over the course of the year, with new commissions, live interventions, discussions and performances within the gallery space. The exhibition is part of a wider Sexology Season of activity across the country including Brighton, Southampton, Manchester and Glasgow.</p>

<p>Explore our idiosyncratic A to Z illustrated with a curious combination of Henry Wellcome' s weird and wonderful collection of objects, medical artefacts, paintings, photographs and sculptures, and some equally intriguing contemporary artworks.</p>
<p>Watch the birth of the first test-tube baby (B for Birthdays), listen to Florence Nightingale speak (V for Voice) and sneak a peek at porcelain fruit showing sexual foreplay (X for X-rated).</p>
<p>Our fabulous visitor experience team will further feed your curiosity with live ' busking' on topics such as neuroscience and phantom limb syndrome, and offer lessons in forgotten skills such as foot binding, trephination and phrenology. Busking activities take place Tuesday-Sunday at 11.30-12.00 and 14.30-15.00, and also at 18.30-19.00 on Thursdays.</p>
<p>We invite you, as fellow experts on the <strong>#HumanCondition</strong>, to add your own idiosyncrasies to this quirky show by participating in the gallery or via social media. Each letter of our idiosyncratic A to Z comes with an invitation for you to participate. For example, under A for Acts of Faith, an illustrator will sketch out your accidents and near misses in the spirit of the displayed ex-voto paintings to the saints. Further along the alphabet, under F for Fears, we will ask you to kindly let go of your phobias next to our 17th-century etching of De Monstris and a Nicobar Island figure used to ward off evil spirits. To participate via social media, see ‘For your contribution’ below.</p>
<p><em>This exhibition runs throughout the summer ahead of our <a href=""/what-we-do/wellcome-collection-growing"">development project</a>, which is due for completion in spring 2015.</em></p>

<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"" dir=""ltr"">'The Generosity Plates' by artist John Newling is an intervention in the Wellcome Collection cafe and foyer. Newling takes the Moringa oleifera tree, often called the miracle tree or famine tree, as a means of exploring our relationship with ecology and the values immanent in nature.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"" dir=""ltr"">On display in the foyer will be nine pressed and framed Moringa trees that Newling originally germinated in December 2010 at Nottingham Contemporary, and a new set of young trees growing hydroponically. A collection of plates, featuring images of the trees, has been produced specially for the use of customers in the Wellcome Cafe.</p>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"" dir=""ltr"">Also included are recent works made from pressed Moringas, whose roots and branches form shapes reminiscent of letters or symbols. These the artist has gilded, so that the trees enter their final transformation into a series of 'Charm Language' bracelets.</p>

<p>What happens when you set up six artist residencies in different medical research centres throughout the world? This intimate exhibition showcases a diverse body of work from the artists who worked in research centres in Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Thailand, Vietnam and the UK.</p>
<p>The artists were invited to spend at least six months exploring the activity of researchers and produce new work in response to their experiences. The result is a series of moving, challenging and humorous works, richly varied in form and tone. They record journeys taken within the complex realm that lies between scientific processes and local communities, often on the frontlines of communicable diseases.</p>

See our <a href=""/opening-hours"">opening hours</a>.</p>
<p>Wayne McGregor is well known for his physically testing choreography and ground-breaking collaborations across dance, film, music, visual art, technology and science. In 2000, he and his company Wayne McGregor | Random Dance embarked on a series of projects investigating aspects of creativity in dance with researchers from other fields such as cognitive and social science.</p>
<p>This exhibition, staged during the run-up to the first performances of his new work for Wayne McGregor | Random Dance, 'Atomos' at Sadler's Wells, offers a glimpse into this interdisciplinary research process and the impact it has in the rehearsal studio. Find out more about the process of choreography and how mind, body and movement interact in each of us.</p>
<p>From Saturday 28 September to Sunday 13 October there will be opportunities to meet dancers who have experience of working with the ideas discussed in the exhibition. The dancers will offer a unique insight into and practical demonstration of physical thinking techniques. Sessions will run on Thursdays 18.00-21.00, Saturdays and Sundays 14.00-17.00.

"47","/exhibitions/souzou-outsider-art-japan","Souzou: Outsider Art from Japan","<p>Our spring exhibition brings together more than 300 works for the first major display of Japanese Outsider Art in the UK. The 46 artists represented in the show are residents and day attendees at social welfare institutions across Japan. The wonderfully diverse collection comprises ceramics, textiles, paintings, sculpture and drawings.</p>
<p>'Souzou' has no direct translation in English but a dual meaning in Japanese: written one way, it means creation, and in another it means imagination. Both meanings allude to a force by which new ideas are born and take shape in the world.</p>
<p class=""NoSpacing"">The exhibition has been organised in association with Het Dolhuys, the Museum of Psychiatry in Haarlem (the Netherlands) and the Social Welfare Organisation Aiseikai (Tokyo). It reflects the growing acclaim for Outsider Art - often defined as works made by self-taught artists perceived to be at the margins of society - while questioning assumptions about the category itself.</p>
<p class=""NoSpacing"">Eschewing a purely biographical approach, the show will be object-led, with a startling array of works offering singular and affecting explorations of culture, memory and creativity. A series of documentary films featuring a selection of the exhibiting artists will play at the end of the exhibition.</p>
<p>This will be our last major exhibition before our <a href=""/what-we-do/wellcome-collection-growing"">exciting development project</a> kicks off in summer 2013.</p>

"46","/exhibitions/georgie-meadows-stitched-drawings","Georgie Meadows: Stitched Drawings","<h2>A display in the Wellcome Collection foyer</h2>
<p>Georgie Meadows: Stitched drawings brings together 20 textile artworks which explore personal experiences of ageing and dementia. Meadows, a Monmouth based artist and occupational therapist, crafts uniquely affecting and compassionate portraits, translating line drawings of people she knows or has cared for into stitched works.</p>
<p>Using a domestic sewing machine to sew through two pieces of cloth, separated by wadding, Meadows creates delicate pieces whose tangled threads are both a metaphor for the scrambling of neural connections during degenerative illness and a tender and tactile form of portraiture. The works present a collision of tight-knotted threads and loose stuffing, of softness and jagged edges. Meadows' concern with the primacy of visual communication in the act of caring, when logic and speech are often elusive, gives the portraits a meditative empathy, with the confusions of illness set beside the kindness held in the simple and reflective acts of looking and seeing.</p>
<p>Short snapshot stories which accompany the artist's works movingly outline the daily challenges and triumphs of her sitters: a woman finds people assume her to be grumpy since losing her teeth the success of a man's day is measured by his dressing himself a woman is hungry but her brain will no longer tell her how to eat. Meadows' works are a testament to courage and resilience in the face of a loss of control and identity.</p>

Assembled by Richard Harris, a former antique print dealer based in Chicago, the collection is spectacularly diverse, including art works, historical artefacts, scientific specimens and ephemera from across the world. Rare prints by Rembrandt, Dürer and Goya will be displayed alongside anatomical drawings, war art and antique metamorphic postcards human remains will be juxtaposed with Renaissance vanitas paintings and twentieth century installations celebrating Mexico' s Day of the Dead. From a group of ancient Incan skulls, to a spectacular chandelier made of 3000 plaster-cast bones by British artist Jodie Carey, this singular collection, by turns disturbing, macabre and moving, opens a window upon our enduring desire to make peace with death.</p>

<p>Wellcome Collection's Youth Programme has been working with artist Andy Merritt and young people from New Horizon Youth Centre to create an installation called 'Super Thinking' .</p>
<p>Linking scientific and technological advances to human experience, the installation will explore ideas in Wellcome Collection' s forthcoming exhibition, 'Superhuman' (19 July-16 October).</p>
<p>Seven research and art workshops, led by Andy, engaged young people in the creative processes of making mood boards and mind maps around the theme of human enhancement. The workshops mainly took place at New Horizon Youth Centre in Chalton Street, but also involved an introduction to Wellcome Collection for the young people, so they could gather research and inspiration about human enhancement from the exhibits already on show in our permanent collections.</p>
<p>Their second visit here, at the end of the project, will be for them to review their work as Andy assembles it for the final installation on the glass wall in the atrium. It will be a three-dimensional representation of a mind map. Using vinyl, plastic tubing and suckers, the young artists will create word shapes and then colour the tubes with acrylic paint. The whole process will enable them to reflect on key exhibition themes while constructing an art installation that is both eye-catching and thought provoking.</p>
<p>Wellcome Collection's Youth Programme aims to engage young people between the ages of 14 and 19 in participatory projects, involving schools and the local community, that build knowledge, inspire creativity and promote confidence.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.nhyouthcentre.org.uk/"">New Horizon Youth Centre</a> is a day centre that sees up to 3000 young people a year and is open seven days a week. By working with disadvantaged young people, it aims to help them gain skills and knowledge to improve their life chances and to help them move from adolescence into adulthood.</p>
<p>Andy Merritt is an established artist working in socially driven installations and sculptures. He works either solo or through Something & Son, a practice he co-founded in 2010. His artworks present social and environmental issues through installations or sculptures that use everyday objects and scenarios with surreal outcomes, often by exploring new technologies and techniques. He also has extensive experience of working on collaborative art projects with young people.</p>

<h3>A creative research studio by Fevered Sleep.</h3>
<p>We tell ourselves all sorts of stories about animals. Animals fly through our mythology, our unconscious, our cultural history and our literature; they run through our folk tales; they crawl through our dreams.</p>
<p>But what do animals perceive when they perceive us? And what would happen if we really tried to pay attention to them?</p>
<p>Sheep Pig Goat was a creative research studio by Fevered Sleep, commissioned by Wellcome Collection to accompany the exhibition <a href=""/MakingNature"">Making Nature</a>. It explored how well humans see animals as they really are – not as we tell ourselves they are – through a series of improvised encounters between human performers and animal spectators. Alongside these encounters, the project also included lively public debates with leading scientists and artists, exploring different aspects of relations between human and animal. These addressed subjects as diverse as non-human intelligence and emotion, animal rights and justice, and the various ways animals are woven deeply into human cultural history.</p>
<p>With the planet changing rapidly, the stories we tell ourselves about the natural world, the hierarchies we construct, and our definitions of difference, are inextricably linked to our actions, or inactions, towards it. This project invited people to pay more attention to the existence and experience of non-human animals, opening up the possibility of inter-species empathy, and challenging people to assess their own position and responsibilities in a more-than-human world.</p>
<p>Sheep Pig Goat took place in March 2017 in Peckham, London. Unusually for a project in the early stages of research, Sheep Pig Goat was entirely open to the public, and over 500 people took part in the studio visits and public debates.</p>

"3931","/visit-us/notes-process","Notes on the process","<p><strong>Written by the lead project artist Verity-Jane Keefe</strong></p>
<p>What is nature and how is it relevant to us?</p>
<p>Do we have a relationship with nature? Should we?</p>
<p>Can nature thrive in the city?</p>
<p>If we were in a museum of nature as a specimen in 150 years’ time, how would we be represented?</p>
<p>What would our diorama be? Would it be a suitable Natural Habitat or shall we speculate?</p>
<p>Natural Habitat’ has been produced following an intensive workshop period. It both responds to and challenges key notions of what nature is, why we should care, where we can find it and what it looks like. These questions and attempted answers feature as part of an accompanying soundscape alongside collected audio from the local environment.</p>
<p>The diagram above is a map of the work. Objects are ordered and grouped in a number of linear themes, taking you from “Real, now, fact, truth” at the bottom to “Future, fantasy, speculative nature, sci-fi, computer game landscapes” at the top.</p>
<p>The numbered themes are:</p>
<p>7) Architecture: Buildings, personal, place, our city; ordered in chronology from old to new, from left to right</p>
<p>6) Dystopia: Edges of city, periphery, Rainham Marshes, where nature becomes more unquantifiable</p>
<p>5) “Real” Nature: Flora and fauna extracted from our everyday journeys and local environment</p>
<p>4) Alternative Landscape: William Blake headstone, shells, minerals, crystals, driftwood, logs, rocks, public art, monuments, vegetables</p>
<p>3) The Bits: Chicken shop as natural environment for a young person, money as capital, global warming, big ideas, scatterology</p>
<p>2) An Evolution: From crustaceans to dinosaurs to chickens to zoo to farmyard to rubber ducks and fried chicken, a fantasy line-up of beings</p>
<p>1) The Future is Now: Hard-to-reach nature, access, phones and PlayStations as tools to access nature and other worlds. What will remain</p>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<p>You must own the object and have the right to either loan or gift the object to the exhibition</p>
<p>The object must be safe, comply with all applicable laws and not contain any prohibited or hazardous materials, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<ul><li>Living animal and plant specimens</li>
<li>Human remains</li>
<li>Wet specimens and liquids</li>
<li>Perishables</li>
<li>Endangered species</li>
<li>Ivory</li>
<li>Wild flowers</li>
<li>Birds' eggs</li>
<li>Mercury</li>
<li>Highly flammable/explosive material</li>
<li>Firearms</li>
<li>Drugs/chemicals</li>
</ul><p>Please note that any objects that are gifted to the exhibition rather than loaned will not become part of the permanent collection and will be disposed of at the end of their useful life.</p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h4>Can I bring my bird’s egg collection?</h4>
<p>No, we can’t accept bird eggs. It’s illegal to take the eggs of most wild birds.</p>
<h4>Why can’t I bring ivory?</h4>
<p>There are laws against ivory trading, to help end illegal elephant poaching, so we can’t accept any objects containing ivory. Ivory can be found in items such as jewellery, walking sticks and sculptures.</p>
<h4>What does perishable mean?</h4>
<p>We mean foodstuffs, including fruit and vegetables, meat or packaged items, that could potentially leak or spill, decay, and may attract pests that can cause damage to our collections. If you wish to bring food packaging, it should be empty.</p>
<h4>Is it OK to bring a plant?</h4>
<p>No. We can’t accept any living plants or soil because they can harbour pests, which may pose a risk to our collections.</p>
<h4>Can I bring an artwork by someone I know?</h4>
<p>Yes, as long as they have given permission as the copyright owner (if they are alive).</p>
<h4>What do you mean by human remains?</h4>
<p>Any part of a human, including teeth, hair and bones. It also includes human ashes. We would need a special licence to exhibit these.</p>
<h4>How big can the object be?</h4>
<p>It should be small and light enough to be portable, so that you can bring it here without difficulty.</p>
<h4>Can I bring my fossil collection?</h4>
<p>If you have picked up a loose fossil on the beach, or a pretty rock with the imprint of a mollusc along the side of the road, we would love to see it.</p>
<p>But if you have something rare and spectacular, take it to a specialist scientific collection instead. We can’t accept precious and potentially fragile natural history resources.</p>
<h4>Can I bring herbal remedies?</h4>
<p>No, we cannot accept any herbal remedies or drugs, even if they’re legal. But we may accept empty packaging.</p>

"3809","/sheep-pig-goat-frequently-asked-questions","Sheep Pig Goat: Frequently Asked Questions","<h2>What is Sheep Pig Goat?</h2>
<p><a href=""/sheeppiggoat"">Sheep Pig Goat</a> is a project by Fevered Sleep, commissioned as part of Making Nature, Wellcome Collection’s year-long exploration of our relationship with the natural world. Sheep Pig Goat is a creative research studio by Fevered Sleep exploring how well humans see animals as they really are rather than how we tell ourselves they are. The project will include a series of improvised encounters between human performers and animal spectators. Unusually for a project in the early stages of research, this one is entirely open to the public.</p>
<h2>What can people expect to see?</h2>
<p>Visitors are invited to witness improvised encounters as they happen and join in a conversation with the artists, guest speakers and each other to reflect on the possibility of empathy and communication between different species.</p>
<h2>Why is Wellcome Collection doing this?</h2>
<p>Wellcome Collection is about exploring our place in the world, and this project considers how our view of other animals is tightly bound up with our understanding of ourselves. We are uniquely placed to bring together a range of perspectives, such as philosophy, science and art, to ask how and why we look at animals and what we see when we do.</p>
<h2>Why now?</h2>
<p>With the planet changing rapidly, the stories we tell ourselves about the natural world, the hierarchies, the definitions of difference, are intrinsically linked with our actions, or inactions, towards it. This project is an opportunity to pay more attention to the existence and experience of non-human animals. And that we might perceive something important about ourselves by trying to perceive how other animals perceive us.</p>
<h2>Why sheep, pigs and goats?</h2>
<p>Sheep, pigs and goats are farmed animals. We chose to work with these animals to highlight the gap between the reality of them as species and individuals, and the way in which they are used in food production and perceived in relation to this. In order to safeguard the animals comfort and welfare, sheep, pigs and goats that are used to human contact have been chosen.</p>
<h2>Why this location?</h2>
<p>We selected a location that, unlike a museum, closely resembles barn conditions, with natural daylight and plenty of space for the animals to exercise and move around. Working off-site ensures an environment that prioritises the animal participants and their comfort, and provides a sense of visiting their territory for the human visitors.</p>
<h2>How will you ensure animal welfare standards are met?</h2>
<p>The welfare of the animal participants has been our highest priority throughout this project. Fevered Sleep have followed RSPCA guidelines, as well as working with professional animal wranglers and animal behaviour experts. The individual animals come from a farm in Wales and were carefully selected for their familiarity with human contact. Their owners have advised on and supervised all aspects of the animals’ participation in the project, and will be present on-site to look after them for the duration, in accordance with the RSPCA ‘Five Freedoms’ guidelines. There is 24 hour security on site, the appropriate licenses have been obtained, and there is access to vets if required.</p>
<p>The animals will not be required to ‘perform’ and will take on the role of observer completely on their terms. The encounters will take place within an area prepared for the comfort of the animals, with immediate access to a separate space should the animal become stressed. The length of their involvement in the project each day will be strictly monitored and alternated so no animal is present for longer than 40 minutes at a time. After the project they will return with their owners to their farm in Wales.</p>

"3679","/visit-us/making","Making","<p>In 2008, the Center for PostNatural History was founded in Pittsburgh, USA. It is the only institution in the world solely to collect and record organisms that have been intentionally altered by humans. These range from animals that have been selectively bred and domesticated, such as pigeons and dogs, to those that have been genetically engineered, including laboratory mice, photosensitive bacteria and BioSteel™ goats – all of which they term “PostNatural”.</p>
<p>The objects on display have been selected by the Center for PostNatural History. Unlike traditional natural history museums, the Center defines animals not by their biology but by their cultural history. Through specimens, artworks, books and music they explore some of the ways in which humans have taken control of the reproduction, habitats and DNA of certain animals and the evolutionary implications of this. In turn they acknowledge the role these altered organisms play in sustaining human culture, from the competitive breeding of dogs to the influence of birdsong on human performance.</p>
<p>Together these objects tell a different story of nature, one in which the past, present and future of humans are closely entwined with those of other animals.</p>

"3677","/visit-us/observing","Observing","<p>A trip to the zoo offers the promise of coming face-to-face with a live animal. In their architecture and landscape design, these institutions contend with the challenges of exhibiting nature in unnatural environments. Their history reveals how concepts of nature have evolved and tells of a modern tendency to romanticise wildness.</p>
<p>The naturalistic style of early zoo design later gave way to Modernist architecture that acknowledged the zoo as a public attraction. In the 21st century, new exhibits combine the geographies of animal life and human culture, reflecting a conservationist agenda that seeks to narrow the gap between the two.</p>
<p>The behaviours of the zoo’s human visitors offer insights into the bonds we form with other species. The personas we create for zoo celebrities – individual animals that appear in the media and on merchandise – confirm the importance of storytelling. They speak of the symbolic value of these mascots, onto which we project very human hopes and fears. As with the visually seductive natural history documentaries on our televisions, the danger is of looking at animals but not seeing them.</p>

"3675","/visit-us/displaying","Displaying","<p>Inside natural history museums, preserved animals can be seen in carefully arranged exhibits. The choices museums make about what animals to put on display and how – such as their posture, their appearance and the behaviours they demonstrate – have a profound influence on how we come to think about certain species.</p>
<p>By creating highly realistic exhibits, museums offer an “authentic” experience that reinforces our existing ideas about nature. Over the years these displays have taken different forms. They reflect scientific approaches to understanding other species but they also document wider cultural attitudes that shape, and in turn are shaped by, science. A desire to showcase an empire’s riches or a museum’s educational policy may affect display choices as much as developments in evolution or ecology.</p>
<p>The impact of these exhibits can be felt long after we have left the museum. Representations of certain animals in popular culture often exaggerate the qualities and behaviours expressed in museum displays. These establish themselves in modern folklore, creating animal stereotypes that linger in our collective imagination.</p>

"3673","/visit-us/ordering","Ordering","<p>The idea of a “natural order” in the living world has become embedded in our society. The “great chain of being” began with the ancient Greek philosophers. Later, religious scriptures reinforced this hierarchical structure with divine explanation. By the 18th century, the science of naming, describing and classifying organisms (taxonomy) started seeking rational explanations for the perceived differences between human and non-human animals.</p>
<p>One of the first attempts to record, describe and rank the animal kingdom scientifically was made by Swedish physician and botanist Carl Linnaeus, in his 1735 publication Systema Naturae. Humans were classed as animals for the first time and later named Homo sapiens (“wise man”). Linnaeus described us with the words Nosce te ipsum (“know thyself”), reasoning that our ability to recognise ourselves as human is what separates us from non-human animals.</p>
<p>The Linnaean classification system is a human construct imposed on the natural world. Still in use today, this system affects the value we place on particular animals, which has far-reaching consequences for the world’s biodiversity. Other ways of organising nature have been proposed by artists, writers and scientists. Their works challenge the fixed position of each species in the “great chain of being” and expose its arbitrary divisions.</p>

"3669","/visit-us/introduction","Introduction","<p>How we think about animals is fundamental to how we understand ourselves and our place in the world. The differences and similarities we perceive between humans and non-human animals have been the subject of enquiry since the ancient Greeks, but it was not until the 18th century that we began to seek scientific explanation. Taxonomy – the naming, describing and classifying of organisms – proposed a system for objectively ordering and ranking the animal kingdom. Today, its legacy underpins almost every aspect of our daily lives.</p>
<p>Natural history museums, zoos and wildlife documentaries create representations of nature that frame our ideas about other animals. They arrange the natural world, whether through realistic displays of preserved specimens, the dramatic staging of living animals or the careful editing of film footage. What we see and how we encounter it has a significant effect on our behaviour towards other animals.</p>
<p>With the rapid loss of habitats and species threatening the health of our planet, the historical roots of our beliefs about other animals are coming under scrutiny. Is the separation of humans from other animals – both in our minds and in our environments – compatible with creating a sustainable world?</p>

<p>Step into our digital photo booth and discover your 'psychic transparency'. The concept of psychic transparencies is based on seeing images of the departed (such as figures that would appear in <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=spirit+photography&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&safe=active&gws_rd=cr,ssl&ei=m-z0V9fKOOeOgAaDwYGwAw"">spirit photography</a>), but you might also see scenery, paintings, pictures, art, objects, etc. These extras appeared superimposed upon or alongside the person being photographed, and were explained as projections of psychic transparencies sent from the afterlife; reproductions of objects communicated to the camera telepathically by spirits.</p>
<p><em>Imagine if psychic transparencies were real…</em></p>
<p>That's the approach we've taken with our experimental photo booth project. Located on level 1 by the genome books in our Medicine Now gallery, you can enter the booth and have your psychic transparency revealed and captured onto the online gallery. What will your photo reveal about you?</p>
<p>This project is a collaboration between Wellcome Collection and <a href=""http://photobot.co/"">Photobot.co</a>.</p>

"3545","/visit-us/automated-empathy","Automated Empathy","<p> </p>
<p>We like to blame new technology for old problems. Smartphones lead to anomie; our teens lack social skills because of Minecraft. If modern life is rubbish, screen-based culture only makes it more so. But it was always like this: go back far enough, beyond telephones and televisions, and even the humble novel was once held to account for warping young minds. Perhaps the one thing that hasn’t changed is our propensity to see communications technology in particular as a threat to our vulnerable psyches.</p>
<p>Some have tried to turn the tables. When mental health charity Samaritans launched their ‘Radar’ app in 2014, users could automatically be alerted to friends’ tweets that indicated signs of depression or crisis, and offer help. Well-meant, it fell to pieces in practice: Twitter users felt uneasy about the automation of listening-in to what were in some cases semi-private conversations. Many users with mental health issues felt exposed and unsafe. Samaritans shuttered the service and began a review.</p>
<p>Perhaps it should have been less surprising that the organisation which saw the immense therapeutic potential of the telephone should fail to see the hole in their thinking about the internet. The nasty side of Twitter, the campaigns of bullying and harassment, is well known. Perhaps less well understood is how Twitter functions as a support network for the vulnerable. Twitter is a place where many have found it possible to talk about struggles to cope that they cannot communicate to friends or family, a place where they find affinity with others, and the kindness of strangers. Even on a public account, a whisper of despair in the middle of the night may not be meant for everyone’s eyes: we use Twitter to talk specifically and particularly to each other as well as the world in general.</p>
<p>Erica Scourti’s <i>Empathy Deck </i>is a Twitter bot that lives in this territory, the world of ambiguous emotions and mutual support. <i>Empathy Deck</i> is not human, it is an automaton, but it is not an experiment in the capacity of artificial intelligence to understand the emotions of humans. Rather, it is an exploration of the network’s capacity to deal with an automated actor, but one who speaks from the heart. Using a combination of the artist’s verbal and visual archives, delivered to its followers via @-replies, it offers humorous and perplexing gifts of unique graphic ‘cards’ that reference a semi-mystical popular culture of inspirational and motivational card decks, horoscopes and more.</p>
<p>Methods of self-help like this are central to the final section of Wellcome Collection’s exhibition <i>Bedlam: the asylum and beyond</i>. The exhibition charts the rise and decline of the asylum as both confinement and refuge for those struggling with their mental health. In the asylum’s wake lies a ‘chaotic marketplace of therapies’ according to the exhibition text. There is some return here to traditions of remedy and community that pre-date the asylum, but this marketplace is also literally an economic market, where cures are commodities and healing is linked to profit. As the technological extension of the market, the internet offers information of uncertain provenance, and pharmacological bargains. Can it also offer us the older values of mutual support and healing practices?</p>
<p><i>Empathy Deck </i>is doing its best to answer this question. Unlike most ‘art’ bots, <i>Empathy Deck</i> doesn’t work with language as an abstract quantity or a proof of concept. It’s limited in its generation of new texts, using instead a pre-existing corpus of text, mostly in the form of five years’ worth of Scourti’s own diaries. Object icons pasted over the text and collaged backgrounds respond directly to the content of followers’ tweets. For a bot, <i>Empathy Deck</i> has a lot of depth. Each moment of feeling that it offers in return for one of your own is a very real one; it’s just the sequence that is out of order, because Scourti’s feelings happened first. In this way it’s also a proxy, a substitute, for Scourti herself: she’s been here, and can help you, she just doesn’t have time, so she’s built this bot to do it for her. The idea of the proxy connection, whether digital or human, is a recurring feature in Scourti’s work. Her performance work <i>Personal Proxies </i>(2016)<i> </i>explores the displacement of the ‘authentic’ artist by automated and human agents. In <i>Body Scan </i>(2014), automated image search even provides proxies for Scourti’s own body: intimate phone snaps translated into cosmetic advertising and online medical dictionaries.</p>
<p><i>Empathy Deck</i> is an artwork, not a therapeutic tool. But if there can be proxies for artists, can proxies for therapists be far behind? In both the chaotic marketplace and on the NHS, finding someone who cares and who is qualified to help can be difficult, expensive, or both. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is rapidly becoming the default non-pharmaceutical option for depression and anxiety as well as insomnia, phobias and other disorders. And just as degree courses can be delivered online, so can CBT: the UK government’s national clinical guidelines now advocate the use of computerised CBT for depression, generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder. It’s hard not to see this as austerity healthcare, but it also begs the more fundamental question: if our psychic wounds are gained in contact with each other as humans, can we be patched up and put back together by computers?</p>
<p>And what of the inner life of the bot? When not responding to tweets, the bot talks to itself, to Twitter, to nobody in particular. “I’m a bit lonely at the moment,” it says. “My god I am so angry right now,” reads a fragment of text on a card. Right now? Is the bot angry right now, or was Scourti once angry (why was she angry?) and is it the same thing? As the bot accrues followers and methodically puts together cards for them, Scourti’s personal diaries are progressively revealed. Will we end up with an autobiographical account we can piece together, or has the bot re-made Scourti in its own image? Perhaps the point at which bots become real for us is the point at which we care how they are feeling.</p>

<h3>What is Empathy Deck?</h3>
<p>Empathy Deck is an art commission for Wellcome Collection by Erica Scourti, part of our exhibition ‘<a href=""/bedlam"">Bedlam: the asylum and beyond</a>’.</p>
<p>It is a Twitter bot which generates responses to tweets by its followers. It makes new ‘cards’ from an imaginary, infinite deck of possible responses, composed of images and text generated from Erica’s personal diary and various self help and therapeutic texts. Cards are a gift for the recipient at that moment in time. Empathy Deck also occasionally makes cards for itself.</p>
<p><strong>Empathy Deck is not intended to provide genuine therapy or advice</strong>. If you, or somebody you know, would like mental health advice or support you can contact the following resources:</p>

<h3>How do I get a reply from Empathy Deck?</h3>
<p>You must be following <a href=""https://twitter.com/empathydeck"">@empathydeck on Twitter</a>; it will follow you back a short while after you follow it. Then, if you say anything that it feels it can empathise with, it might make you a card. It doesn’t respond to all tweets, and it responds infrequently; it’s looking for those particular tweets that might be suitable for an empathetic response.</p>
<p>There are no guarantees of a response. The Empathy Deck will not reply to retweets, and it won’t get involved in conversations you’re already having. If you tweet regularly, you’ll probably receive something every few days from it at most.</p>
<h3>I want to see what Empathy Deck is doing but I do not want it to reply to me. Is that possible?</h3>
<p>If you follow it, it will probably follow you back - that’s how it works. You can always <a href=""https://twitter.com/empathydeck"">visit its Twitter page</a> to view the latest output and responses without having to follow it.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How do I stop getting replies from Empathy Deck?</h3>
<p>Simply unfollow Empathy Deck on Twitter, and within an hour or so it will unfollow you back.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>I have a problem with or question about something Empathy Deck has done.</h3>
<p>If you have a problem with or question about Empathy Deck, please contact <a href=""mailto:empathydeck@wellcome.ac.uk"">empathydeck@wellcome.ac.uk</a></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Empathy Deck has sent me something that doesn’t quite make sense.</h3>
<p>Our bot is doing its best, and the card that it offers is always in good faith. It doesn’t always get it right, but then few of us do.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How does Empathy Deck work?</h3>
<p>The technology behind Empathy Deck was built by <a href=""http://tomarmitage.com/"">Tom Armitage</a>. The Deck creates responses by observing the users who follow it on Twitter. When a user says something that it can respond to, it creates a brand new card, just for them, as a gift.</p>
<p>It responds to straightforward tweets, rather than replies to other users or retweets. It’s more likely to respond to tweets which contain descriptions of feelings or situations that also appear in Erica’s personal diary. It doesn’t just look for matching words; it also looks for similar usage and context.</p>
<p>The text on cards comes from a combination of texts including Erica Scourti’s diary and self-help texts. The text is stitched together using computational logic, but it is almost never artificially ‘generated’ - you’ll almost always be receiving words that Erica has written. There is a single style of card that does generate text; this style will try to make new fragments of Erica’s diary.</p>
<p>The cards are drawn in one of four styles designed by Erica. Once the Deck has chosen a style of card and some text, it tries to add an image sticker to the card that it feels is relevant to the text. Then it sends the card to that user as a Twitter reply.</p>
<p>The Empathy Deck tries to be a good citizen on Twitter. It doesn’t instantly follow users back; it won’t follow back suspect or spammy accounts; it won’t repeatedly bombard you with responses; it won’t respond to things it feels may be problematic; it also filters its own output to avoid causing offense.</p>

"3465","/empathydeck","Erica Scourti: Empathy Deck","<p>Empathy Deck is a live Twitter bot that responds to your tweets with unique digital cards, combining image and text.</p>
<p>Inspired by the language of divination card systems like tarot, the bot uses five years’ worth of the artist’s personal diaries intercut with texts from a range of therapeutic and self-help literatures. The texts are accompanied by symbols drawn from the artist’s photo archive, in an echo of the contemporary pictographic language of emoticons.</p>
<p>Somewhere between an overly enthusiastic new friend who responds to every tweet with a ‘me-too!’ anecdote of their own and an ever-ready advice dispenser, the bot attempts an empathic response based on similar experiences. It raises questions about the automation of intangible human qualities like empathy, friendship and care, in a world in which online interactions are increasingly replacing mental health and care services.</p>
<p><strong>Erica Scourti</strong> is a Gringlish artist, born in Athens and based in London, who works across different media including performance, text and video. Her work draws on personal experience to explore life, labour, love and gender in a fully mediated, networked world.</p>

<p>‘Skeletons: Our Buried Bones’ is a collaboration between Wellcome Collection and the Museum of London, touring to Glasgow, Bristol and Leeds over 2016-2018.</p>
<h2>Touring to</h2>
<ul><li><strong><a href=""http://www.gla.ac.uk/hunterian/visit/exhibitions/exhibitionprogramme/skeletonsourburiedbones/"">The Hunterian</a>, Glasgow</strong> 19 August 2016-8 January 2017</li>

<li><strong><a href=""http://www.leeds.gov.uk/skeletons""><strong>Leeds City Museum</strong></a> </strong>22 September 2017-7 January 2018</li>
</ul><p>As we go about our busy lives, little do we imagine that we are walking over the bones of generations of our predecessors. Urban burials are disturbed by the development of the city above them, yielding up their dead so the city can live. Meanwhile, archaeologists balance ethical concerns with the goal of seeking knowledge and understanding of the communities that have gone before us.</p>
<p>Drawn in part from the Museum of London's astonishing collection of over 20,000 skeletons spanning 16 centuries, this touring exhibition examines the bones of some of those who lived, died and were buried across the UK.</p>
<p>Showing skeletons from London along with skeletons from the local area of each hosting venue, the exhibition reflects our rich past and varied social geography; from the pauper’s graves of urban London to the solitary burial of a high status individual on a Scottish island beach.</p>
<p>Through careful scientific analysis by the team at the Museum of London, each skeleton reveals its own story, allowing us fascinating insights into the times in which they lived and the health hazards of the day - from syphilis to rickets, broken bones to tooth decay.</p>
<p>Contextualised by contemporary photographs of the locations in which they were discovered, these few individuals remind us that the dead are all around us. They offer us a rare glimpse into the lives of a small number of the many millions who have gone before us and who form part of the layers of our human history.</p>
<p>This touring exhibition is based on '<a href=""/exhibitions/skeletons-london%E2%80%99s-buried-bones"">Skeletons: London’s Buried Bones</a>', originally shown at Wellcome Collection in 2008.</p>

<p>Bobby Baker is one of the most widely acclaimed and popular performance artists working today. She began her diary drawings in 1997 when she became a patient at a day centre. Originally private, they gradually became a way for her to communicate complex thoughts and emotions that are difficult to articulate to her family, friends and professionals.</p>
<p class=""arrow_purple_box"">The drawings cover Bobby's experiences of day hospitals, acute psychiatric wards, 'crisis' teams and a variety of treatments. They chart the ups and downs of her recovery, family life, work as an artist, breast cancer and just how funny all this harrowing stuff can be.</p>

"2985","/visit-us/programme-what-potential","Programme: What is Potential? ","<p>Nature, according to Aristotle, is an inner principle of change and being at rest. If nature has the ability for transform itself, how do we make the most of this potentiality? The events of the day investigate potential and risk both in art and medicine.</p>
<h2>Timed events</h2>
<h3>14.00: Theodore Zeldin and Per Hüttner in conversation</h3>
<p>Taking Zeldin’s recent book <em>The Hidden Pleasures of Life</em> as a starting-point, the discussion centres on the potential of art to enrich our lives at work and in private and the role it could play tomorrow.</p>
<h3>15.00: Loss of Breath/Lost for Words – Kihlberg & Henry</h3>
<p>A reading about breath: the forgotten, unheard breaths behind all the talk, where breath does the reading, and the reading becomes breath.</p>
<h3>16.00: Ménage à Trois – Sara Giannini</h3>
<p>This lecture invites the audience to be a part of a collective investigation into potentiality and risk of the threesome. Starting with the metamorphic figure of Salomé, moving on to Henry Wellcome and a Scandinavian voyage/exhibition entitled ‘Ö’, the reading will follow other triangulations in order to delve into the engine of desire: the negation of its promise.</p>
<h2>Ongoing throughout the afternoon </h2>
<h3>Metamorphosis I: Primordial paste – Vilma Luostarinen with Alison Taylor and Louise Waite</h3>
<p>Metamorphoses is a series of poetic and material explorations where the boundaries of what is human and innate becomes blurred. In this first experiment, an unknown black substance is explored through the act of kneading.</p>
<h3>The Soft – Natasha Rosling</h3>
<p>Rosling uses sounds to explore the interface between the material and immaterial. She will attempt to build a ‘sonic prosthesis’ that charts physical forms based on anatomical illustrations and fantasies about the human body.</p>
<h3>Psychotron Mind/Body Split – Samon Takahashi</h3>
<p>The artist invites the audience to participate in a small ritual that blurs the borders between mental and physical experience.</p>
<h3>Nunc Stans: Drifters – Valentina Miorandi and Sandrine Nicoletta</h3>
<p>A lamp that allow us to discover the true colour of our universe.</p>
<h3>I am the Future – Per Huttner</h3>
<p>Three living sculptures that invite the audience to reflect on the future of healthcare and medicine.</p>

<p>Chris Dorley-Brown’s ‘15 Seconds part 3’ is a tantalising glimpse into the lives of 26 millennials born in the 1980s, and the ways in which they have changed between childhood and adulthood.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.firstsite.uk.net/page/15-seconds-part-3-wellcometrust"">'15 Seconds Part 3' can be seen at Colchester Firstsite from Saturday 5 - Sunday 27 September 2015</a>.</p>
<p>In 1994, several hundred Colchester schoolchildren aged 8-11 were invited to make a video portrait of themselves and experience their ‘fifteen seconds of fame’. Ten years later, Dorley-Brown tracked down some of the individual participants to find out how their lives had progressed; and in 2014 he made a third series of video portraits. Brought together as a digital online artwork, the participants' three selves now enter into a dialogue with each other.</p>
<p>The first set of video portraits were made in an era before the internet became a part of everyday life; the last set were made in the era when self-presentation through social media is ubiquitous. In between are a poignant series of moving portraits that address growing up, thwarted ambition and finding out what makes you happy in life.</p>

<p><strong>In August 2013 we embarked on a major development project to make Wellcome Collection bigger and bolder than ever before. Our key ambition was to open up the building, offering a more immersive experience for visitors who want to delve deeper into the themes we explore.</strong></p>
<p>With the help of Stirling Prize-winning architects Wilkinson Eyre, we’ve created a stunning staircase leading to more gallery spaces and some beautiful spaces for our public events. Our new level 1 gallery showcases year-long thematic exhibitions (currently showing <a href=""/exhibitions/institute-sexology"">The Institute of Sexology</a>); our new Studio provides the perfect workspace for 14-to-19-year-olds and a spectacular new incarnation of our <a href=""/readingroom"">Reading Room</a> acts as a bridge between exhibitions and the <a href=""http://wellcomelibrary.org/"">Library</a>.

"2469","/visit-us/bernard-spilsbury%E2%80%99s-case-cards","Bernard Spilsbury’s case cards","<p>Dr Bernard Spilsbury (1877–1947) was an extraordinary forensic pathologist who gained fame and notoriety by testifying in a number of contentious murder cases. His career in forensic medicine began in London in 1905 when he was appointed by St Mary’s Hospital to conduct post-mortem examinations for all of the hospital’s cases of sudden death. Conducting such examinations became Spilsbury’s special expertise and by the end of his 40-year career he had carried out an estimated 20,000 autopsies.</p>
<p>The strength of his medical convictions and his composure under cross-examination made Spilsbury an irreplaceable asset in the courtroom, leading to his appointment as the ‘Honorary Pathologist to the Home Office’ and to a subsequent knighthood. Considered by many as the father of modern forensic pathology, Spilsbury’s work was crucial in establishing the importance of precise post-mortem examinations for the conviction of criminals. However, Spilsbury remains a controversial figure in the history of forensic medicine and many believe that his fame gave him too much power to affect the judgement of a jury, resulting in frequent miscarriages of justice. Questions have also been raised over the ways in which his political views, on subjects such as abortion and homosexuality, may have affected the impartiality of his professional judgement.</p>
<p>Spilsbury kept personal records of the pathological investigations he conducted, and collated these records on a vast set of over 7,000 index cards. These case cards are held in the Wellcome Library archives; the first box of cards, covering 1905 to 1913, is now available to view online. Due to the sensitive information included on the cards, only cases that are over 100 years old have been made digitally available. The rest of the collection is available in physical form and can be viewed in the Rare Materials Room. These cards include a number of murders and suicides as well as many cases of illegal abortion and unexpected deaths from natural causes and accidents. Where the information was available, cards include the name and age of the deceased, as well as the date, location and cause of death. These handwritten cards also contain a medical description of the internal and external state of the body in question. In certain examples Spilsbury has gone so far as to include sketches of wounds and background information on the deceased. If cases were widely reported in the press, or where they are of special legal interest, the doctor attached newspaper clippings to the card and wrote out the case name and the verdict of the court.</p>
<p>The 12 case cards displayed on the following pages offer a cross-section of Spilsbury’s early work and highlight some of the surprising stories contained in his archive. These cards are an important resource for the history of forensic medicine, but they are also personal records, which shine a light on the lives and deaths of Londoners in the early 20th century.</p>

"2467","/visit-us/enter-forensics-medicine-and-media-early-19th-century","Enter Forensics: Medicine and the media in the early 19th century","<p>The first half of the 19th century was a time of popular murder trials and public hangings. Word of particularly gruesome crimes spread quickly across the country, stirring the public consciousness and inciting thousands to travel to the courts and congregate around the gallows to witness the spectacle of justice at first hand.</p>
<p>Two separate developments converged at this time which helped to provoke widespread fascination with the courts: the mechanisation of the printing press made mass-produced pamphlets and broadsides cheap enough to reach the general public, and the nascent field of forensic medicine was just gaining a foothold in the legal system.</p>
<p>While the history of forensic medicine can be traced back through renaissance Europe to at least the Roman Empire, medical expertise did not receive systematic legal recognition in Britain until the beginning of the 19th century. The discipline was also gaining academic acknowledgement at this time and in 1807 Edinburgh University was the first to introduce a Chair of Medical Jurisprudence, a position granted to Professor Andrew Duncan the younger.</p>
<p>The reports displayed here retell the stories of ten trials that took place in England and Scotland in the first half of the 19th century. The popular pamphlets, which are now viewable in the Wellcome Library player, contain incredible detail. Some include complete transcripts of the trials, drawings depicting the scene of the crime or the defendant in the dock, and even descriptions of the executions that followed. In some of these cases, the emerging field of forensic medicine has made its mark, while in others it is noticeable by its absence.</p>

<h2>When we’re busiest</h2>
<p>We introduce queues for exhibitions only when necessary.</p>
<p>The busiest times of the week are usually Saturday and Sunday afternoons, when we often have queues for temporary exhibitions. Thursday evenings (when we’re open until 22.00) vary depending on events: you can usually go straight into the exhibitions without waiting, but sometimes you may need to queue.</p>
<p>On weekend mornings and weekdays (except Mondays, when the galleries are closed), you can usually go straight in.</p>
<p><a href=""/fridaylate"">Friday Late Spectaculars</a> can get very busy.</p>
<h2>Timed tickets</h2>
<p>On occasion, when queues get too long, we introduce timed tickets instead. We only give tickets to visitors who are already in the building - there’s no booking in advance or by phone. We only do this at the very busiest times - typically the opening and closing weekends of exhibitions.</p>
<h2>Medicine Man, Medicine Now and the Reading Room</h2>

<p><strong>18 April - 31 July 2015</strong></p>
<p>Explore sexology, the interdisciplinary study of human sexuality, through this eclectic season of 37 events. Our partners are Glasgow Women’s Library, The Arches (Behaviour Festival), conFAB, Fun Palaces and Aye Write Festival. The programme offers something for anyone prepared to undress their mind and includes performances, exhibitions, films, workshops, talks, literature events and - unique to the Glasgow season - three walks around the city which approach the sexology theme in intriguingly different ways, from fetish sex and cottaging to prostitution, drunken sex and romance. Gender, sexuality and feminism are strong themes in Glasgow and a vibrant sense of the city’s heritage and character informs the choice of subjects, performers and speakers.</p>

<p>Our collections cover more than just books, journals, archives and manuscripts: we also have a fantastic collection of artworks, audio and film collections.

"5","/visit-us/group-visits","Group visits","<h2 class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"" dir=""ltr""><strong>Thinking of bringing a group to Wellcome Collection?</strong></h2>
<p>We ask all groups of more than 10 people to inform us of their visit - please email <a href=""mailto:groups@wellcomecollection.org"">groups@wellcomecollection.org</a> or call 0207 611 2222 to let us know your plans.<br /><br />
	Please note we have groups booked in at 11.30-12.00 and 14.30-15.00, so to get the most out of your visit, please avoid these times where possible. We offer free guided tours for groups of 8-20 at these times, however these sessions tend to be popular and book out quickly. We require at least three weeks notice in order to arrange staff for these tours. Please allow a week for us to respond to your enquiry in case we are particularly busy in the galleries.<br /><br />
	For BSL interpreted, speech-to-text-transcribed, or audio described events and tours, or for any other accessibility related enquiries, please email <a href=""mailto:access@wellcomecollection.org?subject=Access%20Tours"">access@wellcomecollection.org</a> or call 020 7611 2222.</p>
<h2 class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"" dir=""ltr""><strong>Breakout and teaching spaces</strong></h2>
<p class=""ImmTextAlign_Left"" dir=""ltr"">Unfortunately we are unable to provide a dedicated space for groups to use for teaching purposes or picnics as part of a visit to Wellcome Collection. Groups are welcome to enjoy the café or restaurant, but only food from the venue can be consumed in these areas. The cafe is first come, first seated, however you can book a table in <a href=""https://wellcomecollection.org/visit-us/wellcome-kitchen"">Wellcome Kitchen</a>, our restaurant on level 2. Several <a href=""http://www.google.com/maps?f=q& source=s_q& hl=en& geocode=& q=London+NW1+2BE,+United+Kingdom& aq=0& vps=1& sll=37.0625,-95.677068& sspn=30.875284,56.337891& ie=UTF8& hq=& hnear=London+NW1+2BE,+United+Kingdom""> nearby parks</a> may provide a scenic alternative for picnics in summer. Alternatively, the Plaza outside Euston Station has picnic tables available for public use.<br /><br /><strong>Please note</strong>: our galleries are closed on Mondays and all group visits are subject to the availability of exhibitions. We consider our gallery content to be most suitable for visitors aged 14+. If you are planning on bringing a group under the age of 14, please call 020 7611 2222 or email <a href=""mailto:info@wellcomecollection.org"">info@wellcomecollection.org</a> to discuss the content of our exhibitions. All visitors should be aware that our permanent exhibitions and many of our special exhibitions contain human remains, objects with sexual content and images of graphic surgical procedures.</p>

"7","/visit-us/events-tickets","Events tickets","<p>All our exhibitions are free. Find out about <a href=""/busytimes"">entry at busy times</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>majority of our events are also free but some </strong><strong>require visitors to have a ticket to attend</strong>.</p>
<p>This is so that we can manage numbers to ensure everyone has the best possible experience at our events. <strong>Please be aware that booking a ticket for a free event does not guarantee your place. Admission is on a first come, first served basis for ticket-holders.</strong> As we offer a free and popular public programme, we have to significantly overbook to allow for no-shows and to avoid having any empty seats which could otherwise be enjoyed by those who would like to attend.</p>
<p>If you have previously registered to order event tickets, you can <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/"">log in to your account here</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Free events: ticketed</strong></h2>
<p>As our events are free, bookings are limited to two per person.</p>
<h2><strong>Waiting list policy</strong></h2>
<p>A waiting list will operate for most free ticketed events. This opens in Wellcome Collection 60 minutes before the event starts and must be registered for in person. If you register for the waiting list, you'll be given a numbered ticket to take away, so you can enjoy the café, galleries and bookshop if they are open before the event. Moments before it starts, pre-booked places that fail to show are allocated to waiting list ticket holders according to the numbers on their tickets.</p>
<p>If you come to register for the waiting list in person, you can take away a maximum of two tickets.</p>
<h2><strong>Free events: drop in</strong></h2>
<p>We try to programme some drop-in events every month. These include our Packed Lunch events and our late-night events, where activities happen all over the building. For these events you just have to turn up, and there is usually room for everyone.</p>
<h2>Timed tickets</h2>
<p>Our exhibitions are free and you can drop in at any time. However, at busy times we operate a timed ticketing system to manage safe and comfortable numbers in the galleries. Tickets are free and are issued from the Information Point on level 0.</p>
<p>Currently, timed tickets are routinely being used on weekends from 12.00 onwards, and on Thursday evenings from 18.00. However, we may need to use them at any time if visitor numbers are high.</p>
<p>Please be aware that timed tickets are first come, first served and can run out early in the day, so please call us (020 7611 2222) or check our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/wellcomecollection"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/ExploreWellcome"">Twitter</a> pages for updates before travelling.</p>
<p>We are usually less busy during the daytime Tuesdays–Fridays, so we recommended planning your visit on those days if possible.</p>
<h2>In-gallery events</h2>
<p>Some of our ‘drop-in’ events take place in the gallery space. At busy times, we will be operating timed tickets for entry into the gallery to manage visitor numbers. If this is the case, please collect a ticket first from the Information Point on level 0. These tickets are first come, first served and please be aware that tickets can run out if we are busy.</p>
<h2><strong>Paid events</strong></h2>
<p>Some of our events are paid, and these open for booking as soon as we publicise them. This is usually when our What's On guide comes out.</p>
<p>Where we offer concessionary rates, these apply for people over 60, students, people on jobseekers allowance and people registered as disabled. Assistants for people registered as disabled go free.</p>
<h2><strong>Making a booking</strong></h2>
<p>We accept online booking for free events only. Please book online if you have internet access because our phone lines get very busy and you may have to wait to speak to someone. We ask visitors not to leave phone messages or email us to book tickets because we cannot process bookings in this way.</p>
<p>To book paid events, call our information line on 0207 611 2222.</p>
<h2><strong>Access</strong></h2>
<p>Wellcome Collection is committed to providing access to our events for visitors with disabilities. For further information, please see <a href=""/visit-us/accessibility"">our accessibility page</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Feedback</strong></h2>
<p>We are continually working to improve our booking process and appreciate any ideas or feedback you might have. Please email your comments to <a href=""mailto:info@wellcomecollection.org"">info@wellcomecollection.org</a></p>

It will be a three-dimensional representation of a mind map. Using vinyl, plastic tubing and suckers, the young artists will create word shapes and then colour the tubes with acrylic paint. The whole process will enable them to reflect on key exhibition themes while constructing an art installation that is both eye-catching and thought provoking.",

Her work borrows from other cultural forms like anthropology, human geography and most of all theatre, and engages strategies of reenactment, camouflage and ventriloquism. She is currently pursuing an AHRC-funded PhD, researching invisible theatre and spatial politics at the Slade. Leah is a founder member of art collective TRIPOD, and works as a freelance writer and an arts educator in gallery, higher education and school contexts.",

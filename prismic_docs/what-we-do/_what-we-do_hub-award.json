We recognise that impact can mean many different things, ranging from an event, journal article or exhibition to the creation of new knowledge, methodologies or partnerships. The Hub, sitting uniquely above a museum, library and public space, is able to offer a dynamic alternative to conventional research environments, encouraging new and experimental forms of learning to emerge.",

The group was made from young people living in London who were selected following a short application process. The inspiration for our project was the exhibition ‘A museum of modern nature’.",

In the process, they developed their film-making skills in areas such as storyboarding, filming, sound recording and editing. At the centre of the project was a three-day trip that focused on wilderness survival skills, involving a wide variety of activities from firelighting to wilderness first aid. This experience formed the main content for the group’s final films, which they decided to create in three different styles, focusing on different aspects of their relationships with nature: beauty and freedom, technology and connection, and experiences and their value.",

Artist Daniel Wallis worked with three groups: Centre 404, St Pancras Community Centre and the Studio Art Group based at Becontree Psychotherapy Centre in Dagenham. Daniel went out to visit each group at their own 'venue' before and after their visit to Wellcome Collection so that their Souzou experience could be tailored to their specific interests and needs, and so they were meeting a familiar face when they stepped into an unfamiliar setting.

These proved a cathartic and liberating experience for those who took part, gradually letting go of their fear of 'doing it wrong' and opening up to each other and Elaine about their lives and challenges whilst being creative together. See a selection of photographs showing the sessions and the work produced via Flickr. Read Elaine's blog posts about the project below.",

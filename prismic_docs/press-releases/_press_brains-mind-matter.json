Brains: The mind as matter (29 March to 17 June 2012) explores what humans have done to brains in the name of medical intervention, scientific enquiry, cultural meaning and technological change. Featuring more than 150 objects including real brains, artworks, manuscripts, artefacts, videos and photography, Brains follows the long quest to manipulate and decipher the most unique and mysterious of human organs, whose secrets continue to confound and inspire.",

Works by contemporary artists including Helen Pynor, Andrew Carnie, Annie Cattrell, Susan Aldworth, Jonathon Keats and Katharine Dowson offer personal responses to the form and physical matter of the organ, while the cultural significance of the rituals, rhetoric and reality of handling brains is explored across centuries.",

If microscopic cellular staining techniques developed in the late 19th century enabled a new understanding of localised neural processes, the rise of phrenology and anthropometry demonstrates the ease with which societal prejudice fed into analysis of outward brain shape and size. From Bernard Hollander's cranial measuring system to the tools and models of phrenology, used to circumscribe comparative types of humanity, the skewed morality of these pseudo-sciences illustrates the measuring of brains as a measure of culture.",

From early visualisations by Reisch, Vesalius and Descartes in the 16th and 17th centuries, through beautiful 19th century paintings by Charles Bell, to the latest kaleidoscopic Brainbow images of nerve cells created by Jeff Lichtman and his team, the artistic drive to apprehend the complexities of the brain follow the increasing philosophical and medical understanding of its centrality to our being. Wax models, used since antiquity, gain extraordinary intricacy in renderings of the brain, and exquisite, groundbreaking drawings of brain cells by Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal, considered by many as the father of modern neuroscience, are also on display.",

A 5000 year-old skull with holes drilled (or trephined) into it illustrates how long humans have been intervening directly in the matter of the brain, and the exhibition takes a long view of tools and methods, from crude trephination kits to bullet locators and complex Setred 3D imaging systems, and looks at the human stories behind the anatomy (the separation of parts by cutting) of brains. Arresting portraits of patients under the care of Dr Harvey Cushing and his pioneering surgical techniques at the turn of the last century sit beside the work of artist Corrine Day, which records her as she prepares to undergo brain surgery in 1996, while engravings of earlier patients undergoing treatment offer a grim reminder of the realities of a pre-anaesthetic age.",

Giving/Taking traces the stories of brain harvesting and the variety of its purpose, from the horrors of Nazi mass murder and experimentation to the hope offered by research into neurodegenerative disorders by today's brain banks. Newly commissioned photography and film of key brain archives and the process of dissection (together with wet samples, artefacts and moving portraits of brain donors by Ania Dabrowska), offer a behind-the-scenes view of the brain's life after death.",

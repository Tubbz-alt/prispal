Featuring works by contemporary artists including Allora & Calzadilla, Phillip Warnell and Abbas Akhavan, the exhibition asks how and why we look at animals and what we see when we do.",

This recent work questions the definitions of difference between species, establishing this as an idea that runs throughout the exhibition.",

His efforts to record, describe and classify the animal kingdom, solved the practical problem of identifying species but introduced a manmade ranking system. Similarly, Charles Bonnet’s Scale of Natural Beings 1783 provided a ladder of the animal kingdom with humans placed at the top. Such views are challenged by the depictions of animals, and human-like animals, in Jonathan Swift’s satire of man, Gulliver’s Travels.",

Contemporary photographers Richard Ross and Hiroshi Sugimoto, expose the complexities of successive attempts to give visitors an authentic representation of the animal in a museum setting, revealing works of art as yet another form of mediation.",

The New Architecture and The London Zoo 1936, a film by László Moholy-Nagy and images of the zoo’s elephant and rhino pavilion, designed by Casson Condor architects, provide examples of how the designs of zoo enclosures are used to frame animals. The phenomenon of the ‘zoo-pet’, or mascot, is explored through cases like Jumbo the elephant, adored by Victorian audiences and subject of a public outcry when he was sold to P.T. Barnum’s Circus in 1882. Souvenirs and toys will show how zoo animals have frequently been anthropomorphised in popular culture.",

This includes the domesticated pigeons that helped inform Charles Darwin’s theories of natural selection and the genetic modification of mosquitos in the fight against disease spread. Further case studies comprise dog breeding, the origins of laboratory mice and rats, and a history of songbirds as told by musicologist Ian Nagoski. Unlike traditional natural history collections, the significance of postnatural organisms lies in the role they play in human culture.",

Beautiful, mysterious, and often disturbing, the objects Wellcome collected range from the ancient to the magical, the religious to the scientific. The Phantom Museum offers some personal responses to this vast but little-known collection. Playful and thought-provoking contributions combine text and images, fact and fiction, to consider how objects can be read depending on who views them and when.",

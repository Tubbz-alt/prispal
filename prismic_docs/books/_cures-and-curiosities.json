Open to the public, it is a rich and unparalleled resource of over a million items spanning 3000 years, in which rare and surprising objects from anthropology, folk art, alchemy and witchcraft jostle for space alongside more conventional medical records and archives. This book is a fascinating introduction to the Library's special collections.",

Lavishly illustrated with more than 150 photographs, in full colour throughout, and punctuated by personal comments from authors who have used the Library (including Kathryn Hughes, Philip Hoare and Gillian Tindall), this is an invaluable record of the wonders of a memorable collection, and a testament to the rich complexity of medicine through the centuries.",
